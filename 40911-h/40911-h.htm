<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">"E</span><span class="smcap">ther</span> or Æther (&#945;&#953;&#952;&#951;&#961; probably from
&#945;&#953;&#952;&#969; I burn,) a material substance of a
more subtle kind than visible bodies, supposed
to exist in those parts of space which are apparently
empty."</p>

<p>So begins the article "Ether," written for the
ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, by
James Clerk Maxwell.</p>

<p>The derivation of the word seems to indicate
some connexion in men's minds with the idea of
Fire: the other three "elements," Earth, Water,
Air, representing the solid, liquid, and gaseous
conditions of ordinary matter respectively. The
name Æther suggests a far more subtle or penetrating
and ultra-material kind of substance.</p>

<p>Newton employs the term for the medium
which fills space&mdash;not only space which appears
to be empty, but space also which appears to be
full; for the luminiferous ether must undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
penetrate between the atoms&mdash;must exist in the
pores so to speak&mdash;of every transparent substance,
else light could not travel through it. The following
is an extract from Newton's surmises concerning
this medium:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Qu. 18. If in two large tall cylindrical
Vessels of Glass inverted, two little Thermometers
be suspended so as not to touch the
Vessels, and the Air be drawn out of one of
these Vessels, and these Vessels thus prepared
be carried out of a cold place into a
warm one; the Thermometer <i>in vacuo</i> will
grow warm as much and almost as soon as
the Thermometer which is not <i>in vacuo</i>.
And when the vessels are carried back into
the cold place, the Thermometer <i>in vacuo</i>
will grow cold almost as soon as the other
Thermometer. Is not the Heat of the warm
Room conveyed through the Vacuum by the
Vibrations of a much subtiler Medium than
Air, which after the Air was drawn out remained
in the Vacuum? And is not this
Medium the same with that Medium by which
Light is [transmitted], and by whose Vibra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>tions
Light communicates Heat to Bodies?...
And do not the Vibrations of this
Medium in hot Bodies contribute to the
intenseness and duration of their Heat?
And do not hot Bodies communicate their
Heat to contiguous cold ones by the Vibrations
of this Medium propagated from them
into the cold ones? And is not this Medium
exceedingly more rare and subtile than the
Air, and exceedingly more elastic and
active? And doth it not readily pervade all
bodies? And is it not (by its elastic force)
expanded through all the Heavens?"</p>

<p>"Qu. 22. May not Planets and Comets,
and all gross Bodies, perform their motions
more freely, and with less resistance in this
Æthereal Medium than in any Fluid, which
fills all Space adequately without leaving
any Pores, and by consequence is much
denser than Quick-silver and Gold? And
may not its resistance be so small, as to be
inconsiderable? For instance; if this <i>Æther</i>
(for so I will call it) should be supposed
700000 times more elastic than our Air,
and above 700000 times more rare; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
resistance would be above 600000000 times
less than that of Water. And so small a
resistance would scarce make any sensible
alteration in the Motions of the Planets in
ten thousand Years."</p></blockquote>

<p>That the ether, if there be such a thing in
space, can pass readily into or through matter is
often held proven by tilting a mercury barometer;
when the mercury rises to fill the transparent
vacuum. Everything points to its universal permeance,
if it exist at all.</p>

<p>But these, after all, are antique thoughts.
Electric and Magnetic information has led us
beyond them into a region of greater certainty
and knowledge; so that now I am able to advocate
a view of the Ether which makes it not only
uniformly present and all-pervading, but also
massive and substantial beyond conception. It
is turning out to be by far the most substantial
thing&mdash;perhaps the only substantial thing&mdash;in
the material universe. Compared to ether the
densest matter, such as lead or gold, is a filmy
gossamer structure; like a comet's tail or a milky
way, or like a salt in very dilute solution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>To lead up to and justify the idea of the reality
and substantiality, and vast though as yet largely
unrecognised importance, of the Ether of Space,
the following chapters have been written. Some
of them represent the expanded notes of lectures
which have been given in various places&mdash;chiefly
the Royal Institution; while the first chapter
represents a lecture before the Ashmolean Society
of the University of Oxford in June, 1889.
One chapter (viz. Chap. <a href="#Page_13">II</a>) has already been
printed as part of an appendix to the third
edition of <i>Modern Views of Electricity</i>, as well as
in the <i>Fortnightly</i> and <i>North American Reviews</i>;
but no other chapters have yet been published,
though parts appear in more elaborate form in
Proceedings or Transactions of learned societies.</p>

<p>The problem of the constitution of the Ether,
and of the way in which portions of it are modified
to form the atoms or other constituent units of
ordinary matter, has not yet been solved. Much
work has been done in this direction by various
mathematicians, but much more remains to be
done. And until it is done, some scepticism is
reasonable&mdash;perhaps laudable. Meanwhile there
are few physicists who will dissent from Clerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Maxwell's penultimate sentence in the article
"Ether" of which the beginning has already
been quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whatever difficulties we may have in
forming a consistent idea of the constitution
of the æther, there can be no doubt that the
interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not
empty, but are occupied by a material substance
or body, which is certainly the largest,
and probably the most uniform body of
which we have any knowledge."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE ETHER OF SPACE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE LUMINIFEROUS ETHER AND THE<br />
MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> oldest and best known function for an
ether is the conveyance of light, and hence
the name "luminiferous" was applied to it;
though at the present day many more functions are
known, and more will almost certainly be discovered.</p>

<p>To begin with it is best to learn what we can,
concerning the properties of the Interstellar Ether,
from the phenomena of Light.</p>

<p>For now wellnigh a century we have had
a wave theory of light; and a wave theory of
light is quite certainly true. It is directly demonstrable
that light consists of waves of some kind
or other, and that these waves travel at a certain
well-known velocity,&mdash;achieving a distance equal
to seven times the circumference of the earth
every second; from New York to London and back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in the thirtieth part of a second; and taking only
eight minutes on the journey from the sun to the
earth. This propagation in time of an undulatory
disturbance necessarily involves a medium. If
waves setting out from the sun exist in space eight
minutes before striking our eyes, there must
necessarily be in space some medium in which
they exist and which conveys them. Waves we
cannot have, unless they be waves in something.</p>

<p>No ordinary matter is competent to transmit
waves at anything like the speed of light: the
rate at which <i>matter</i> conveys waves is the velocity
of sound,&mdash;a speed comparable to one-millionth
of the speed of light. Hence the luminiferous
medium must be a special kind of substance; and
it is called the ether. The <i>luminiferous</i> ether it
used to be called, because the conveyance of
light was all it was then known to be capable of;
but now that it is known to do a variety of other
things also, the qualifying adjective may be
dropped. But, inasmuch as the term 'ether' is
also applied to a familiar organic compound, we
may distinguish the ultra-material luminiferous
medium by calling it the Ether of Space.</p>

<p>Wave-motion in ether, light certainly is; but
what does one mean by the term wave? The
popular notion is, I suppose, of something heaving
up and down, or perhaps of something breaking on
a shore. But if you ask a mathematician what he
means by a wave, he will probably reply that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
most general wave is such a function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
and <i>t</i> as to satisfy the differential equation</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num">d²y</span> / <span class="denom">dt²</span>
 = <span class="num">(v²) d²y</span> / <span class="denom">dx²</span>;</p>

<p class="noin">while the simplest wave is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>y</i> = <i>a</i> <i>sin</i> (<i>x</i> &#8722; <i>vt</i>).</p>

<p>And he might possibly refuse to give any other
answer.</p>

<p>And in refusing to give any other answer than
this, or its equivalent in ordinary words, he is
entirely justified; that <i>is</i> what is meant by the
term wave, and nothing less general would be all-inclusive.</p>

<p>Translated into ordinary English the phrase
signifies, with accuracy and comprehensive
completeness, the full details of "a disturbance
periodic both in space and time." Anything thus
doubly periodic is a wave; and all waves&mdash;whether
in air as sound waves, or in ether as light
waves, or on the surface of water as ocean waves&mdash;can
be comprehended in the definition.</p>

<p>What properties are essential to a medium
capable of transmitting wave-motion? Roughly
we may say two: <i>elasticity</i> and <i>inertia</i>. Elasticity
in some form, or some equivalent of it,&mdash;in order
to be able to store up energy and effect recoil;
inertia,&mdash;in order to enable the disturbed substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to overshoot the mark and oscillate beyond its
place of equilibrium to and fro. Any medium
possessing these two properties can transmit
waves, and unless a medium possesses these
properties in some form or other, or some equivalent
for them, it may be said with moderate
security to be incompetent to transmit waves.
But if we make this latter statement one must be
prepared to extend to the terms elasticity and
inertia their very largest and broadest signification,
so as to include any possible kind of restoring
force, and any possible kind of persistence of
motion, respectively.</p>

<p>These matters may be illustrated in many ways,
but perhaps a simple loaded lath, or spring, in a
vice will serve well enough. Pull it to one side,
and its elasticity tends to make it recoil; let it
go, and its inertia causes it to overshoot its normal
position. That is what inertia is,&mdash;power of overshooting
a mark, or, more accurately, power of
moving for a time even against driving force,&mdash;power
to rush uphill. Both causes together make
it swing to and fro till its energy is exhausted.
This is a disturbance simply periodic in time. A
regular series of such springs, set at equal intervals
and started vibrating at regular intervals of time
one after the other, would be periodic in space
too; and so they would, in disconnected fashion,
typify a wave. A series of pendulums will do just
as well, and if set swinging in orderly fashion will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
furnish at once an example and an appearance of
wave motion, which the most casual observer
must recognise as such. The row of springs
obviously possesses elasticity and inertia; and
any wave-transmitting medium must similarly
possess some form of elasticity and some form of
inertia.</p>

<p>But now proceed to ask what is this Ether
which in the case of light is thus vibrating? What
corresponds to the elastic displacement and recoil
of the spring or pendulum? What corresponds
to the inertia whereby it overshoots its mark?
Do we know these properties in the ether in any
other way?</p>

<p>The answer, given first by Clerk Maxwell, and
now reiterated and insisted on by experiments
performed in every important laboratory in the
world, is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The elastic displacement corresponds to
electrostatic charge,&mdash;roughly speaking, to
electricity.</p>

<p>The inertia corresponds to magnetism.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noin">This is the basis of the modern electromagnetic
theory of light.</p>

<p>Let me attempt to illustrate the meaning of
this statement, by reviewing some fundamental
electrical facts in the light of these analogies:&mdash;</p>

<p>The old and familiar operation of charging a
Leyden jar&mdash;the storing up of energy in a strained
dielectric&mdash;any electrostatic charging <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>whatever is
quite analogous to the drawing aside of our
flexible spring. It is making use of the elasticity
of the ether to produce a tendency to recoil.
Letting go the spring is analogous to permitting a
discharge of the jar&mdash;permitting the strained
dielectric to recover itself&mdash;the electrostatic disturbance
to subside.</p>

<p>In nearly all the experiments of electrostatics
etherial elasticity is manifest.</p>

<p>Next consider inertia. How would one illustrate
the fact that water, for instance, possesses
inertia&mdash;the power of persisting in motion against
obstacles&mdash;the power of possessing kinetic energy?
The most direct way would be, to take a stream
of water and try suddenly to stop it. Open a
water tap freely and then suddenly shut it. The
impetus or momentum of the stopped water makes
itself manifest by a violent shock to the pipe,
with which everybody must be familiar. This
momentum of water is utilised by engineers in
the "water-ram."</p>

<p>A precisely analogous experiment in Electricity
is what Faraday called "the extra current."
Send a current through a coil of wire round a
piece of iron, or take any other arrangement for
developing powerful magnetism, and then suddenly
stop the current by breaking the circuit.
A violent flash occurs, if the stoppage is sudden
enough, a flash which means the bursting of the
insulating air partition by the accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
electromagnetic momentum. The scientific name
for this electrical inertia is "self-induction."</p>

<p>Briefly we may say that nearly all electromagnetic
experiments illustrate the fact of etherial
inertia.</p>

<p>Now return to consider what happens when a
charged conductor (say a Leyden jar) is discharged.
The recoil of the strained dielectric causes a
current, the inertia of this current causes it to
overshoot the mark, and for an instant the charge
of the jar is reversed; the current now flows
backwards and charges the jar up as at first;
back again flows the current; and so on, charging
and reversing the charge, with rapid oscillations,
until the energy is all dissipated into heat. The
operation is precisely analogous to the release of
a strained spring, or to the plucking of a stretched
string.</p>

<p>But the discharging body, thus thrown into
strong electrical vibration, is imbedded in the all-pervading
ether; and we have just seen that the
ether possesses the two properties requisite for
the generation and transmission of waves, viz.:
elasticity, and inertia or density; hence just as
a tuning fork vibrating in air excites aërial waves,
or sound, so a discharging Leyden jar in ether
excites etherial waves, or light.</p>

<p>Etherial waves can therefore be actually produced
by direct electrical means. I discharge here
a jar, and the room is for an instant filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
light. With light, I say, though you can see
nothing. You can see and hear the spark indeed&mdash;but
that is a mere secondary disturbance we can
for the present ignore&mdash;I do not mean any secondary
disturbance. I mean the true etherial waves
emitted by the electric oscillation going on in the
neighbourhood of the recoiling dielectric. You
pull aside the prong of a tuning fork and let it go:
vibration follows and sound is produced. You
charge a Leyden jar and let it discharge: vibration
follows and light is excited.</p>

<p>It is light, just as good as any other light. It
travels at the same pace, it is reflected and refracted
according to the same laws; every experiment
known to optics can be performed with this
etherial radiation electrically produced,&mdash;and yet
you cannot see it. Why not? For no fault of
the light, the fault (if there be a fault) is in the eye.
The retina is incompetent to respond to these
vibrations&mdash;they are too slow. The vibrations
set up when this large jar is discharged are from
a hundred thousand to a million per second, but
that is too slow for the retina. It responds only
to vibrations between 400 billion and 700 billion
per second. The vibrations are too quick for the
ear, which responds only to vibrations between
40 and 40,000 per second. Between the highest
audible and the lowest visible vibrations there has
been hitherto a great gap, which these electric
oscillations go far to fill up. There has been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
great gap simply because we have no intermediate
sense organ to detect rates of vibration between
40,000 and 400,000,000,000,000 per second. It
was therefore an unexplored territory. Waves have
been there all the time in any quantity, but we
have not thought about them nor attended to
them.</p>

<p>It happens that I have myself succeeded in
getting electric oscillations so slow as to be
audible,&mdash;the lowest I had got in 1889 were 125
per second, and for some way above this the
sparks emit a musical note; but no one has yet
succeeded in directly making electric oscillations
which are visible,&mdash;though indirectly every one
does it when they light a candle.</p>

<p>It is easy, however, to have an electric oscillator
which vibrates 300 million times a second, and
emits etherial waves a yard long. The whole
range of vibrations between musical tones and
some thousand million per second, is now filled up.</p>

<p>With the large condensers and self-inductances
employed in modern cable telegraphy, it is easy
to get a series of beautifully regular and gradually
damped electric oscillations, with a period of two
or three seconds, recorded by an ordinary signalling
instrument or siphon recorder.</p>

<p>These electromagnetic waves in space have been
known on the side of theory ever since 1865, but
interest in them was immensely quickened by the
discovery of a receiver or detector for them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
great though simple discovery by Hertz, in 1888,
of an "electric eye," as Lord Kelvin called it,
made experiments on these waves for the first time
easy or even possible. From that time onward we
possessed a sort of artificial sense organ for their
appreciation,&mdash;an electric arrangement which can
virtually "see" these intermediate rates of vibration.</p>

<p>Since then Branly discovered that metallic
powder could be used as an extraordinarily sensitive
detector; and on the basis of this discovery,
the 'coherer' was employed by me for distant
signalling by means of electric or etheric waves;
until now when many other detectors are available
in the various systems of wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>With these Hertzian waves all manner of
optical experiments can be performed. They can
be reflected by plain sheets of metal, concentrated
by parabolic reflectors, refracted by prisms,
and concentrated by lenses. I have made, for
instance, a large lens of pitch, weighing over
three hundredweight, for concentrating them to a
focus.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They can be made to show the phenomenon
of interference, and thus have their wave-length
accurately measured. They are stopped
by all conductors, and transmitted by all insulators.
Metals are opaque; but even imperfect insulators,
such as wood or stone, are strikingly transparent;
and waves may be received in one room from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
source in another, the door between the two being
shut.</p>

<p>The real nature of metallic opacity and of transparency
has long been clear in Maxwell's theory
of light, and these electrically produced waves
only illustrate and bring home the well-known
facts. The experiments of Hertz are, in fact, the
apotheosis of Maxwell's theory.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thus, then, in every way, Clerk Maxwell's brilliant
perception or mathematical deduction, in
1865, of the real nature of light is abundantly
justified; and for the first time we have a true
theory of light,&mdash;no longer based upon analogy
with sound, nor upon the supposed properties of
some hypothetical jelly or elastic solid, but capable
of being treated upon a substantial basis of its
own, in alliance with the sciences of Electricity
and of Magnetism.</p>

<p>Light is an electromagnetic disturbance of the
ether. Optics is a branch of electricity. Outstanding
problems in optics are being rapidly
solved, now that we have the means of definitely
exciting light with a full perception of what we
are doing, and of the precise mode of its vibration.</p>

<p>It remains to find out how to shorten down the
waves&mdash;to hurry up the vibration until the light
becomes visible. Nothing is wanted but quicker
modes of vibration. Smaller oscillators must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
used&mdash;very much smaller&mdash;oscillators not much
bigger than molecules. In all probability&mdash;one
may almost say certainly&mdash;ordinary light is the
result of electric oscillation in the molecules or
atoms of hot bodies, or sometimes of bodies not hot&mdash;as
in the phenomenon of phosphorescence.</p>

<p>The direct generation of <i>visible</i> light by electric
means, so soon as we have learnt how to attain
the necessary frequency of vibration, will have
most important practical consequences; and
that matter is initially dealt with in a section on
the Manufacture of Light, § 149, in Chapter XIV
of <i>Modern Views of Electricity</i>. But here we
abandon further consideration of this aspect of
our great subject.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE INTERSTELLAR ETHER AS A<br />
CONNECTING MEDIUM</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">S</span><span class="smcap">o</span> far I have given a general idea of the
present condition of the wave theory of
light, both from its theoretical and from its
experimental sides. The waves of light are not
anything mechanical or material, but are something
electrical and magnetic&mdash;they are in fact
electrical disturbances periodic in space and time,
and travelling with a known and tremendous
speed through the ether of space. Their very
existence depends upon the ether, and their speed
of propagation is its best known and most certain
quantitative property.</p>

<p>A statement of this kind does not even initially
express a tithe of our knowledge on the subject;
nor does our knowledge exhaust any large part
of the region of discoverable fact; but the statement
above made may be regarded as certain,
although the absence of mechanics or ordinary
dynamics about it removes it, or seems to remove
it, from the category of the historically soundest
and best worked department of Physical Science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
viz. that explored by the Newtonian method.
Though in truth there is every reason to suppose
that we should have had Newton with us in these
modern developments.</p>

<p>There is, I believe, a general tendency to underrate
the certainty of some of the convictions to
which natural philosophers have gradually, in the
course of their study of nature, been impelled;
more especially when those convictions have
reference to something intangible and occult.
The existence of a continuous space-filling medium,
for instance, is probably regarded by most educated
people as a more or less fanciful hypothesis, a figment
of the scientific imagination,&mdash;a mode of
collating and welding together a certain number
of observed facts, but not in any physical sense
a reality, as water and air are realities.</p>

<p>I am speaking purely physically. There may
be another point of view from which all material
reality can be denied, but with those questions
physics proper has nothing to do; it accepts the
evidence of the senses, regarding them as the tools
or instruments wherewith man may hope to understand
one definite aspect of the universe; and it
leaves to philosophers, equipped from a different
armoury, the other aspects which the material
universe may&mdash;nay, must&mdash;possess.</p>

<p>By a physical "explanation" is meant a clear
statement of a fact or law in terms of something
with which daily life has made us familiar. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are all chiefly familiar, from our youth up, with
two apparently simple things, <i>motion</i> and <i>force</i>.
We have a direct sense for both these things. We
do not understand them in any deep way, probably
we do not understand them at all, but we are
accustomed to them. Motion and force are our
primary objects of experience and consciousness;
and in terms of them all other less familiar
occurrences may conceivably be stated and
grasped. Whenever a thing can be so clearly and
definitely stated, it is said to be explained, or
understood; we are said to have "a dynamical
theory" of it. Anything short of this may be
a provisional or partial theory, an explanation of
the less known in terms of the more known, but
Motion and Force are postulated in physics as the
completely known: and no attempt is made to
press the terms of an explanation further than
that. A dynamical theory is recognised as being
at once necessary and sufficient.</p>

<p>Now, it must be admitted at once that of very
few things have we at present such a dynamical
explanation. We have no such explanation of
matter, for instance, or of gravitation, or of
electricity, or ether, or light. It is always conceivable
that of some such things no purely dynamical
explanation will ever be forthcoming, because
something more than motion and force may perhaps
be essentially involved. Still, physics is
bound to push the search for an explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to its furthest limits; and so long as it does not
hoodwink itself by vagueness and mere phrases&mdash;a
feebleness against which its leaders are mightily
and sometimes cruelly on their guard, preferring
to risk the rejection of worthy ideas rather than
permit a semi-acceptance of anything fanciful
and obscure&mdash;so long as it vigorously probes all
phenomena within its reach, seeking to reduce
the physical aspect of them to terms of motion
and force,&mdash;so long it must be upon a safe track.
And, by its failure to deal with certain phenomena,
it will learn&mdash;it already begins to suspect, its
leaders must long have surmised&mdash;the existence
of some third, as yet unknown, category, by
incorporating which the physics of the future
may rise to higher flights and an enlarged
scope.</p>

<p>I have said that the things of which we are
permanently conscious are motion and force,
but there is a third thing which we have likewise
been all our lives in contact with, and which we
know even more primarily, though perhaps we
are so immersed in it that our knowledge realises
itself later,&mdash;viz. life and mind. I do not now
pretend to define these terms, or to speculate as
to whether the things they denote are essentially
one and not two. They <i>exist</i>, in the sense in
which we permit ourselves to use that word, and
they are not yet incorporated into physics. Till
they are, they may remain more or less vague;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but how or when they can be incorporated, is not
for me even to conjecture.</p>

<p>Still, it is open to a physicist to state how the
universe appears to him, in its broad character
and physical aspect. If I were to make the
attempt I should find it necessary for the sake
of clearness to begin with the simplest and most
fundamental ideas; in order to illustrate, by facts
and notions in universal knowledge, the kind of
process which essentially occurs in connection
with the formation of higher and less familiar
conceptions,&mdash;in regions where the common information
of the race is so slight as to be useless.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Primary Acquaintance with the External World.</i></p>

<p>Beginning with our most fundamental sense I
should sketch the matter thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>We have muscles and can move. I cannot
analyse motion,&mdash;I doubt if the attempt is wise,&mdash;it
is a simple immediate act of perception, a direct
sense of free unresisted muscular action. We may
indeed move without feeling it, and that teaches
us nothing, but we may move so as to feel it,
and this teaches us much, and leads to our first
scientific inference, viz. <i>space</i>; that is, simply, room
to move about. We might have had a sense of being
jammed into a full or tight-packed universe; but
we have not: we feel it to be a spacious one.</p>

<p>Of course we do not stop at this baldness of
inference: our educated faculty leads us to realise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the existence of space far beyond the possibility
of direct sensation; and, further, by means of the
direct appreciation of <i>speed</i> in connection with
motion,&mdash;of uniform and variable speed,&mdash;we become
able to formulate the idea of "time," or
uniformity of sequence; and we attain other more
complex notions&mdash;acceleration and the like&mdash;upon
a consideration of which we need not now enter.</p>

<p>But our muscular sense is not limited to the
perception of free motion: we constantly find it
restricted or forcibly resisted. This "muscular
action impeded" is another direct sense, that of
"<i>force</i>"; and attempts to analyse it into anything
simpler than itself have hitherto resulted only in
confusion. By "force" is meant primarily muscular
action not accompanied by motion. Our
sense of this teaches us that space, though roomy,
is not empty: it gives us our second scientific
inference&mdash;what we call "matter."</p>

<p>Again we do not stop at this bare inference.
By another sense, that of pain, or mere sensation,
we discriminate between masses of matter in
apparently intimate relation with ourselves, and
other or foreign lumps of matter; and we use
the first portion as a measure of the extent of the
second. The human body is our standard of size.
We proceed also to subdivide our idea of matter,&mdash;according
to the varieties of resistance with which
it appeals to our muscular sense,&mdash;into four different
states, or "elements" as the ancients called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
them; viz. the solid, the liquid, the gaseous, and
the etherial. The resistance experienced when we
encounter one or other of these forms of material
existence varies from something very impressive&mdash;the
solid,&mdash;through something nearly impalpable&mdash;the
gaseous,&mdash;up to something entirely imaginative,
fanciful, or inferential, viz. the ether.</p>

<p>The ether does not in any way affect our sense of
touch (i.e. of force); it does not resist motion in
the slightest degree. Not only can our bodies move
through it, but much larger bodies, planets and
comets, can rush through it at what we are pleased
to call a prodigious speed (being far greater than
that of an athlete) without showing the least sign
of friction. I myself, indeed, have designed and
carried out a series of delicate experiments to
see whether a whirling mass of iron could to the
smallest extent grip the ether and carry it round,
with so much as a thousandth part of its own
velocity. These shall be described further on,
but meanwhile the result arrived at is distinct.
The answer is, no; I cannot find a trace of mechanical
connection between matter and ether,
of the kind known as viscosity or friction.</p>

<p>Why, then, if it is so impalpable, should we
assert its existence? May it not be a mere fanciful
speculation, to be extruded from physics as soon
as possible? If we were limited for our knowledge
of matter to our sense of touch, the question would
never even have presented itself; we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
been simply ignorant of the ether, as ignorant as
we are of any life or mind in the universe not
associated with some kind of material body.
But our senses have attained a higher stage of
development than that. We are conscious of
matter by means other than its resisting force.
Matter acts on one small portion of our body in a
totally different way, and we are said to <i>taste</i> it.
Even from a distance it is able to fling off small
particles of itself sufficient to affect another
delicate sense. Or again, if it is vibrating with
an appropriate frequency, another part of our
body responds; and the universe is discovered to
be not silent but eloquent to those who have ears
to hear. Are there any more discoveries to be
made? Yes; and already some have been
made. All the senses hitherto mentioned speak
to us of the presence of ordinary matter,&mdash;gross
matter, as it is sometimes called,&mdash;though when
appealing to our sense of smell, and more especially
to a dog's sense of smell, it is not very gross;
still, with the senses hitherto enumerated we
should never have become aware of the ether. A
stroke of lightning might have smitten our bodies
back into their inorganic constituents, or a torpedo-fish
might have inflicted on us a strange kind of
torment; but from these violent tutors we should
have learnt little more than a schoolboy learns
from the once ever-ready cane.</p>

<p>But it so happens that the whole surface of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
skin is sensitive in yet another way, and a small
portion of it is astoundingly and beautifully
sensitive, to an impression of an altogether
different character&mdash;one not necessarily associated
with any form of ordinary matter&mdash;one that will
occur equally well through space from which all
solid, liquid, or gaseous matter has been removed.
Hold your hand near a fire, put your face in the
sunshine, and what is it you feel? You are now
conscious of something not arriving by ordinary
matter at all. You are now as directly conscious
as you can be of the etherial medium. True the
process is not very direct. You cannot apprehend
the ether as you can matter, by touching or tasting
or even smelling it; but the process is analogous
to the kind of perception we might get of ordinary
matter if we had the sense of hearing alone. It
is something akin to <i>vibrations in the ether</i> that
our skin and our eyes feel.</p>

<p>It may be rightly asserted that it is not the
etherial disturbances themselves, but other disturbances
excited by them in our tissues, that our
heat nerves feel; and the same assertion can be
made for our more highly-developed and specialised
sight nerves. All nerves must feel what is occurring
next door to them, and can directly feel nothing
else; but the "radiation," the cause which
excited these disturbances, travelled through the
ether,&mdash;not through any otherwise known material
substance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be a commonplace to rehearse how
we know this. Briefly, thus: Radiation conspicuously
comes to us from the sun. If any
free or ordinary matter exists in the intervening
space, it must be an exceedingly rare gas. In other
words, it must consist of scattered particles of
matter, some big enough to be called lumps, some
so small as to be merely atoms, but each with a
considerable gap between it and its neighbour.
Such isolated particles are absolutely incompetent
to transmit light. And, parenthetically, I may
say that no form of ordinary matter, solid, liquid,
or gaseous, is competent to transmit a thing
travelling with the speed and subject to the known
laws of light. For the conveyance of radiation or
light all ordinary matter is not only incompetent,
but hopelessly and absurdly incompetent. If this
radiation is a thing transmitted by anything at
all, it must be by something <i>sui generis</i>.</p>

<p>But it is transmitted,&mdash;for it takes time on the
journey, travelling at a well-known and definite
speed; and it is a quivering or periodic disturbance,
falling under the general category of wave-motion.
Nothing is more certain than that. No physicist
disputes it. Newton himself, who is commonly
and truly asserted to have promulgated a rival
theory, felt the necessity of an etherial medium,
and knew that light consisted essentially of waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Sight.</i></p>

<p>A small digression here, to avoid any possible
confusion due to the fact that I have purposely
associated together temperature nerves and sight
nerves. They are admittedly not the same,
but they are alike in this, that they both afford
evidence of radiation; and, were we blind, we
might still know a good deal about the sun, and
if our temperature nerves were immensely increased
in delicacy (not all over, for that would
be merely painful, but in some protected region),
we might even learn about the moon, planets,
and stars. In fact, an eye, consisting of a pupil
(preferably a lens) and a sunken cavity lined with
a surface sensitive to heat, could readily be
imagined, and might be somewhat singularly
effective. It would be more than a light recorder,
it could detect all the etherial quiverings caused
by surrounding objects, and hence would see
perfectly well in what we call "the dark." But
it would probably see far too much for convenience,
since it would necessarily be affected by every kind
of radiation in simple proportion to its energy;
unless, indeed, it were provided with a supply of
screens with suitably selected absorbing powers.
But whatever might be the advantage or disadvantage
of such a sense-organ, we as yet do not
possess one. Our eye does not act by detecting
heat; in other words, it is not affected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whole range of etherial quiverings, but only by
a very minute and apparently insignificant
portion. It wholly ignores the ether waves whose
frequency is comparable with that of sound;
and, for thirty or forty octaves above this, nothing
about us responds; but high up, in a range of
vibration of the inconceivably high pitch of four
to seven hundred million million per second&mdash;a
range which extremely few accessible bodies are
able to emit, and which it requires some knowledge
and skill artificially to produce&mdash;to those
waves the eye is acutely, surpassingly, and most
intelligently sensitive.</p>

<p>This little fragment of total radiation is in itself
trivial and negligible. Were it not for men, and
glow-worms, and a few other forms of life, hardly
any of it would ever occur, on such a moderate-sized
lump of matter as the earth. Except for
an occasional volcano, or a flash of lightning, only
gigantic bodies like the sun and stars have energy
enough to produce these higher flute-like notes;
and they do it by sheer main force and violence&mdash;the
violence of their gravitative energy&mdash;producing
not only these, but every other kind of radiation
also. Glow-worms, so far as I know, alone have
learnt the secret of emitting the physiologically
useful waves, and none others.</p>

<p><i>Why</i> these waves are physiologically useful&mdash;why
they are what is called "light," while other
kinds of radiation are "dark," is a question to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
asked, but, at present, only tentatively answered.
The answer must ultimately be given by the
Physiologist; for the distinction between light
and non-light can only be stated in terms of the
eye, and its peculiar specialised sensitiveness;
but a hint may be given him by the Physicist.
The etherial waves which affect the eye and the
photographic plate are of a size not wholly incomparable
with that of the atoms of matter.
When a physical phenomenon is concerned with
the ultimate atoms of matter, it is often relegated
at present to the field of knowledge summarised
under the head of Chemistry. Sight is
probably a chemical sense. The retina may contain
complex aggregations of atoms, shaken asunder
by the incident light vibrations, and rapidly built
up again by the living tissues in which they live;
the nerve-endings meanwhile appreciating them
in their temporarily dissociated condition. A vague
speculation! Not to be further countenanced
except as a working hypothesis leading to examination
of fact; but, nevertheless, the direction
in which the thoughts of some physicists are
tending&mdash;a direction towards which many recently
discovered experimental facts point.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Gravitation and Cohesion.</i></p>

<p>It would take too long to do more than suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
some other functions for which a continuous
medium of communication is necessary. We shall
argue in Chapter <a href="#Page_98">VIII</a> that technical action at a
distance is impossible. A body can only act immediately
on what it is in contact with; it must
be by the action of contiguous particles,&mdash;that is,
practically, through a continuous medium, that
force can be transmitted across space. Radiation is
not the only thing the earth feels from the sun;
there is in addition its gigantic gravitative pull,
<i>a force or tension more than what a million million
steel rods</i>, <i>each seventeen feet in diameter</i>, <i>could stand</i>
(<i>see</i> Chap. <a href="#Page_115">IX</a>). What mechanism transmits this
gigantic force? Again, take a steel bar itself:
when violently stretched, with how great tenacity
its parts cling together! Yet its particles are not
in absolute contact, they are only virtually
attached to each other by means of the universal
connecting medium&mdash;the ether,&mdash;a medium that
must be competent to transmit the greatest
stresses which our knowledge of gravitation and
of cohesion shows us to exist.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Electricity and Magnetism.</i></p>

<p>Hitherto I have mainly confined myself to the
perception of the ether by our ancient sense of
radiation, whereby we detect its subtle and delicate
quiverings. But we are growing a new sense; not
perhaps an actual sense-organ, though not so very
unlike a new sense-organ, though the portions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
matter which go to make the organ are not
associated with our bodies by the usual links of
pain and disease; they are more analogous to
artificial teeth or mechanical limbs, and can be
bought at an instrument-maker's.</p>

<p>Electroscopes, galvanometers, telephones&mdash;delicate
instruments these; not yet eclipsing our
sense-organs of flesh, but in a few cases coming
within measurable distance of their surprising
sensitiveness. And with these what do we do?
Can we smell the ether, or touch it, or what is
the closest analogy? Perhaps there is no useful
analogy; but nevertheless we deal with it, and
that closely. Not yet do we fully realise what we
are doing. Not yet have we any dynamical theory
of electric currents, of static charges, and of
magnetism. Not yet, indeed, have we any dynamical
theory of light. In fact, the ether has
not yet been brought under the domain of simple
mechanics&mdash;it has not yet been reduced to motion
and force: and that probably because the <i>force</i>
aspect of it has been so singularly elusive that it is
a question whether we ought to think of it as
material at all. No, it is apart from mechanics at
present. Conceivably it may remain apart; and
our first additional category, wherewith the
foundations of physics must some day be enlarged,
may turn out to be an etherial one.
And some such inclusion may have to be made
before we can attempt to annex vital or mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
processes. Perhaps they will all come in together.</p>

<p>Howsoever these things be, this is the kind of
meaning lurking in the phrase that we do not yet
know what electricity or what the ether is. We
have as yet no dynamical explanation of either of
them; but the past century has taught us what
seems to their student an overwhelming quantity
of facts about them. And when the present
century, or the century after, lets us deeper into
their secrets, and into the secrets of some other
phenomena now in course of being rationally
investigated, I feel as if it would be no merely
material prospect that will be opening on our
view, but some glimpse into a region of the universe
which Science has never entered yet, but which
has been sought from far, and perhaps blindly
apprehended, by painter and poet, by philosopher
and saint.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Note on the Spelling of Ethereal.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>The usual word "ethereal" suggests something unsubstantial,
and is so used in poetry; but for the prosaic
treatment of Physics it is unsuitable, and etheric has
occasionally been used instead. No just derivation can
be given for such an adjective, however; and I have been
accustomed simply to spell etherial with an <i>i</i> when no
poetic meaning was intended. This alternative spelling
is not incorrect; but Milton uses the variant "ethereous,"
in a sense suggestive of something strong and substantial
(<i>Par. Lost</i>, vi, 473). Either word, therefore, can be employed
to replace "ethereal" in physics: and in succeeding
chapters one or other of these is for the most part
employed.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF MOTION ON VARIOUS<br />
PHENOMENA</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">N</span><span class="smcap">otwithstanding</span> its genuine physical
nature and properties, the ether is singularly
intangible and inaccessible to our senses, and accordingly
is a subject on which it is extremely
difficult to try experiments. Many have been the
attempts to detect some phenomena depending on
its motion relative to the earth. The earth is
travelling round the sun at the rate of 19 miles
a second, and although this is slow compared
with light&mdash;being in fact just about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10,000</sub>th
of the speed of light,&mdash;yet it would seem feasible
to observe some modification of optical phenomena
due to this motion through the ether.</p>

<p>And one such phenomenon is indeed known,
namely, the stellar aberration discovered by
Bradley in 1729. The position of objects not
on the earth, and not connected with the solar
system, is apparently altered by an amount
comparable to one part in ten thousand, by the
earth's motion; that is to say, the apparent place
of a star is shifted from its true place by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
angle <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10,000</sub>th of a "radian,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or about 20
seconds of arc.</p>

<p>This is called Astronomical Aberration, and is
extremely well known. But a number of other
problems open out in connexion with it, and on
these it is desirable to enter into detail. For if
the ether is stationary while the earth is flying
through it&mdash;at a speed vastly faster than any
cannon ball, as much faster than a cannon ball
as an express train is faster than a saunter on foot&mdash;it
is for all practical purposes the same as if the
earth were stationary and the ether streaming
past it with this immense velocity, in the opposite
direction. And some consequence of such a drift
might at first sight certainly be expected. It
might, for instance, seem doubtful whether
terrestrial surveying operations can be conducted,
with the extreme accuracy expected of them,
without some allowance for the violent rush of
the light-conveying medium past and through the
theodolite of the observer.</p>

<p>Let us therefore consider the whole subject
further.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Aberration.</span></p>

<p>Everybody knows that to shoot a bird on the
wing you must aim in front of it. Every one will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
readily admit that to hit a squatting rabbit from
a moving train you must aim behind it.</p>

<p>These are examples of what may be called
"aberration" from the sender's point of view,
from the point of view of the source. And the
aberration, or needful divergence between the
point aimed at and the thing hit has opposite
sign in the two cases&mdash;the case when receiver is
moving, and the case when source is moving.
Hence, if both be moving, it is possible for the
two aberrations to neutralise each other. So to
hit a rabbit running alongside the train you must
aim straight at it.</p>

<p>If there were no air that is all simple enough.
But every rifleman knows to his cost that though
he fixes both himself and his target tightly to the
ground, so as to destroy all aberration proper, yet
a current of air is very competent to introduce a
kind of spurious aberration of its own, which
may be called windage; and that he must not
aim at the target if he wants to hit it, but must
aim a little in the eye of the wind.</p>

<p>So much from the shooter's point of view. Now
attend to the point of view of the target.</p>

<p>Consider it made of soft enough material to be
completely penetrated by the bullet, leaving a
longish hole wherever struck. A person behind
the target, whom we may call a marker, by
applying his eye to the hole immediately after the
hit, may be able to look through it at the shooter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and thereby to spot the successful man. I
know that this is not precisely the function of an
ordinary marker, but it is more complete than his
ordinary function. All he does usually is to
signal an impersonal hit; some one else has to
record the identity of the shooter. I am rather
assuming a volley of shots, and that the marker
has to allocate the hits to their respective sources
by means of the holes made in the target.</p>

<p>Well, will he do it correctly? Assuming, of
course, that he can do so if everything is stationary,
and ignoring all curvature of path, whether vertical
or horizontal curvature. If you think it over you
will perceive that a wind will not prevent his doing
it correctly; the line of hole will point to the
shooter along the path of his bullet, though it will
not point along his line of aim. Also, if the shots
are fired from a moving ship, the line of hole in a
stationary target will point to the position the
gun occupied at the instant the shot was fired,
though it may have moved since then. In neither
of these cases (moving medium and moving source)
will there be any error.</p>

<p>But if the <i>target</i> is in motion, on an armoured
train for instance, then the marker will be at
fault. The hole will not point to the man who
fired the shot, but to an individual ahead of him.
<i>The source will appear to be displaced in the
direction of the observer's motion.</i> This is common
aberration. It is the simplest thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the world. The easiest illustration of it is that
when you run through a vertical shower, you tilt
your umbrella forward; or, if you have not got
one, the drops hit you in the face; more accurately,
your face as you run forward hits the
drops. So the shower appears to come from a
cloud ahead of you, instead of from one overhead.</p>

<p>We have thus three motions to consider, that of
the source, of the receiver, and of the medium;
and, of these, only motion of receiver is able to
cause an aberrational error in fixing the position
of the source.</p>

<p>So far we have attended to the case of projectiles,
with the object of leading up to light.
But light does not consist of projectiles, it consists
of waves; and with waves matters are a
little different. Waves crawl through a medium at
their own definite pace; they cannot be <i>flung</i>
forwards or sideways by a moving source; they
do not move by reason of an initial momentum
which they are gradually expending, as shots
do; their motion is more analogous to that of a
bird or other self-propelling animal, than it is to
that of a shot. The motion of a wave in a
moving medium may be likened to that of
a rowing-boat on a river. It crawls forward
with the water, and it drifts with the water;
its resultant motion is compounded of the two,
but it has nothing to do with the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of its source. A shot from a passing steamer
retains the motion of the steamer as well as that
given it by the powder. It is projected therefore
in a slant direction. But a boat lowered from the
side of a passing steamer, and rowing off, retains
none of the motion of its source; it is not projected,
it is self-propelled. That is like the case
of a wave.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the difference. Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>
shows a moving cannon or machine-gun, moving
with the arrow, and firing a succession of shots
which share the motion of the cannon as well as
their own, and so travel slant. The shot fired
from position 1 has reached A, that fired from
position 2 has reached B, and that fired from
position 3 has reached C, by the time the fourth
shot is fired at D. The line A B C D is a prolongation
of the axis of the gun; it is the line of aim, but
it is not the line of fire; all the shots are travelling
aslant this line, as shown by the arrows. There are
thus two directions to be distinguished. There is
the row of successive shots, and there is the path
of any one shot. These two directions enclose an
angle. It may be called an aberration angle,
because it is due to the motion of the source, but
it need not give rise to any aberration. True
direction may still be perceived from the point of
view of the receiver.</p>

<p>To prove this let us attend to what is happening
at the target. The first shot is supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
entering at A, and if the target is stationary will
leave it at Y. A marker looking along Y A will
see the position whence the shot was fired. This
may be likened to a stationary observer looking
at a moving star. He sees it where and as it was
when the light started on its long journey. He
does not see its present position, but there is no
reason why he should. He does not see its physical
state or anything as it is now. He sees it as it
was when it sent the information which he has
just received. There is no aberration caused by
motion of source.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Shots or Disturbances with Momentum
from a Moving Gun.</span>
</div>

<p>But now let the receiver be moving at same
pace as the gun, as when two grappled ships are
firing into each other. The motion of the target
carries the point Y forward, and the shot A leaves
it at Z, because Z is carried to where Y was.
So in that case the marker looking along Z A will
see the gun, not as it was when firing, but as it is
at the present moment; and he will see likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the row of shots making straight for him. This is
like an observer looking at a terrestrial object.
Motion of the earth does not disturb ordinary
vision.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a> shows as nearly the same sort of thing as
possible for the case of emitted waves. The tube
is a source emitting a succession of disturbances
without momentum. A B C D may be thought
of as horizontally flying birds, or as crests of
waves, or as self-swimming torpedoes; or they
may even be thought of as bullets, if the gun
stands still every time it fires, and only moves
between whiles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Waves or Disturbances without Momentum
from a Moving Source.</span>
</div>

<p>The line A B C D is now neither the line of fire
nor the line of aim: it is simply the locus of
disturbances emitted from the successive positions
1 2 3 4.</p>

<p>A stationary target will be penetrated in the
direction A Y, and this line will point out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
correct position of the source when the received
disturbance started. If the target moves, a
disturbance entering at A may leave it at Z, or
at any other point according to its rate of motion;
the line Z A does not point to the original position
of the source, and so there will be aberration
when the target moves. Otherwise there would
be none.</p>

<img src="images/fig055.jpg" width="400" height="154" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Beam from a Revolving Lighthouse.</span>
</div>

<p>Now Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a> also represents a parallel beam of
light travelling from a moving source, and entering
a telescope or the eye of an observer. The beam
lies along A B C D, but this is not the direction
of vision. The direction of vision, to a stationary
observer, is determined not by the locus of successive
waves, but by the path of each wave.
A ray may be defined as the path of a labelled
disturbance. The line of vision is Y A 1, and
coincides with the line of aim; which in the projectile
case (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>) it did not.</p>

<p>The case of a revolving lighthouse, emitting
long parallel beams of light and brandishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
them rapidly round, is rather interesting. Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>
may assist the thinking out of this case. Successive
disturbances A, B, C, D, lie along a spiral
curve, the spiral of Archimedes; and this is the
shape of the beams, as seen illuminating the dust
particles, though the pitch of the spiral is too
gigantic to be distinguished from a straight line.
At first sight it might seem as if an eye looking
along those curved beams would see the lighthouse
slightly out of its true position; but it is
not so. The true rays or actual paths of each
disturbance are truly radial; they do not coincide
with the apparent beam. An eye looking at
the source will not look tangentially along the
beam, but will look along A S, and will see the
source in its true position. It would be otherwise
for the case of projectiles from a revolving
turret.</p>

<p>Thus, neither translation of star nor rotation
of sun can affect direction. There is no aberration
so long as the receiver is stationary.</p>

<p>But what about a wind, or streaming of the
medium past source and receiver, both stationary?
Look at Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a> again. Suppose a row of stationary
cannon firing shots, which get blown by a cross
wind along the slant 1 A Y (neglecting the curvature
of path which would really exist): still the
hole in the target fixes the gun's true position,
the marker looking along Y A sees the gun which
fired the shot. There is no true deviation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the point of view of the receiver, provided the
drift is uniform everywhere, although the shots
are blown aside and the target is not hit by the
particular gun aimed at it.</p>

<p>With a moving cannon combined with an
opposing wind, Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a> would become very like
Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>.</p>

<p>(N.B.&mdash;The actual case, even without complication
of spinning, etc., but merely with the curved
path caused by steady wind-pressure, is not so
simple, and there would really be an aberration
or apparent displacement of the source towards
the wind's eye: an apparent exaggeration of the
effect of wind shown in the diagram.)</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a> the result of a wind is much the same,
though the details are rather different. The
medium is supposed to be drifting downwards,
across the field. The source may be taken as
stationary at S. The horizontal arrows show the
direction of waves <i>in the medium</i>; the dotted
slant line shows their resultant direction. A
wave centre drifts from D to 1 in the same time
as the disturbance reaches A, travelling down the
slant line D A. The angle between dotted and full
lines is the angle between ray and wave-normal.
Now, <i>if the motion of the medium inside the receiver
is the same as it is outside</i>, the wave will pass
straight on along the slant to Z, and the true
direction of the source is fixed. But if the medium
inside the target or telescope is stationary, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wave will cease to drift as soon as it gets inside,
under cover as it were; it will proceed along the
path it has been really pursuing <i>in the medium</i> all
the time, and make its exit at Y. In this latter
case&mdash;of different motion of the medium inside and
outside the telescope&mdash;the apparent direction, such
as Y A, is not the true direction of the source.
<i>The ray is in fact bent where it enters the differently-moving
medium</i> (as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/fig058.jpg" width="400" height="269" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4. Ray through a Moving Stratum.</span>
</div>

<p>A slower moving stratum bends an oblique
ray, slanting with the motion, in the same direction
as if it were a denser medium. A quicker stratum
bends it oppositely. If a medium is both denser
and quicker moving, it is possible for the two
bendings to be equal and opposite, and thus for
a ray to go on straight. Parenthetically I may
say that this is precisely what happens, on Fresnel's
theory, down the axis of a water-filled telescope
exposed to the general terrestrial ether drift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moving medium waves do not advance in
their normal direction, they advance slantways.
The direction of their advance is properly called
a ray. The ray does not coincide with the wave-normal
in a moving medium.</p>

<img src="images/fig059.jpg" width="400" height="445" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 5. Successive Wave Fronts in a Moving Medium.</span>
</div>

<p>All this is well shown in Fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>.</p>

<p>S is a stationary source emitting successive
waves, which drift as spheres to the right. The
wave which has reached M has its centre at C,
and C M is its normal; but the disturbance, M,
has really travelled along S M, which is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the ray. It has advanced as a wave from S to P,
and has drifted from P to M. Disturbances
subsequently emitted are found along the ray,
precisely as in Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>. A stationary telescope
receiving the light will point straight at S. A
mirror, M, intended to reflect the light straight
back must be set normal to the ray, not tangential
to the wave front.</p>

<p>The diagram also equally represents the case
of a moving source in a stationary medium. The
source, starting at C, has moved to S, emitting
waves as it went; which waves, as emitted, spread
out as simple spheres from the then position of
source as centre. Wave-normal and ray now
coincide: S M is not a ray, but only the locus of
successive disturbances. A stationary telescope
would look not at S, but along M C to a point
where the source was when it emitted the wave M;
a moving telescope, if moving at same rate as
source, will look at S. Hence S M is sometimes
called the <i>apparent</i> ray. The angle S M C is the
aberration angle, which in Chap. <a href="#Page_127">X</a> we denote by &#949;.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a> shows normal reflexion for the case of
a moving medium. The mirror M reflects light
received from S<sub>1</sub>, to a point S<sub>2</sub>,&mdash;just in time to
catch the source there if that is moving with the
medium.</p>

<p>Parenthetically I may say that the time taken
on the double journey, S<sub>1</sub> M S<sub>2</sub>, when the medium
is moving, is not quite the same as the double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
journey S M S, when all is stationary; and that
this is the principle of Michelson's great experiment;

velocity of matter means velocity through
the ether&mdash;which is stationary. If there were

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>EXPERIMENTS ON THE ETHER</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">W</span>e have arrived at this: that a uniform
ether stream all through space causes no
aberration, no error in fixing direction. It blows
the waves along, but it does not disturb the line
of vision.</p>

<p>Stellar aberration exists, but it depends on
motion of observer, and on motion of observer
only. Etherial motion has no effect upon it;
and when the observer is stationary with respect
to object, as he is when using a terrestrial telescope,
there is no aberration at all.</p>

<p>Surveying operations are not rendered the least
inaccurate by the existence of a universal etherial
drift; and they therefore afford no means of
detecting it.</p>

<p>But observe that everything depends on the
ether's motion being uniform everywhere, inside
as well as outside the telescope, and along the
whole path of the ray. If stationary anywhere
it must be stationary altogether: there must be
no boundary between stationary and moving
ether, no plane of slip, no quicker motion even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in some regions than in others. For (referring
back to the remarks preceding Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>) if the ether
in receiver is stagnant while outside it is moving,
a wave which has advanced and drifted as far as
the telescope will cease to drift as soon as it gets
inside, but will advance simply along the wave-normal.
And in general, at the boundary of any
such change of motion a ray will be bent, and an
observer looking along the ray will see the source
not in its true position, not even in the apparent
position appropriate to his own motion, but lagging
behind that position.</p>

<p>Such an aberration as this, a lag or negative
aberration, has never yet been observed; but if
there is any slip between layers of ether, if the
earth carries any ether with it, or if the ether, being
in motion at all, is not equally in motion everywhere
throughout every transparent substance,
then such a lag or negative aberration must occur,
in precise proportion to the amount of the carriage
of ether by moving bodies (<i>cf.</i> p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the ether behaves as a
perfectly frictionless inviscid fluid, or if for any
other reason there is no rub between it and moving
matter, so that the earth carries no ether with it
at all, then all rays will be straight, aberration will
have its simple and well-known value, and we shall
be living in a virtual ether stream of nineteen
miles a second, by reason of the orbital motion
of the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be difficult to imagine that a great mass
like the earth can rush at this tremendous pace
through a medium without disturbing it. It is
not possible for an ordinary sphere in an ordinary
fluid. At the surface of such a sphere there is a
viscous drag, and a spinning motion diffuses out
thence through the fluid, so that the energy of
the moving body is gradually dissipated. The
persistence of terrestrial and planetary motions
shows that etherial viscosity, if existent, is small;
or at least that the amount of energy thus got
rid of is a very small fraction of the whole. But
there is nothing to show that an appreciable layer
of ether may not adhere to the earth and travel
with it, even though the force acting on it be but
small.</p>

<p>This, then, is the question before us:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Does the earth drag some ether with it? or does it
slip through the ether with perfect freedom?</i> (Never
mind the earth's atmosphere; the part it plays is
known and not important.)</p>

<p>In other words, is the ether wholly or partially
stagnant near the earth, or is it streaming past
us with the opposite of the full terrestrial velocity
of nineteen miles a second? Surely if we are living
in an ether stream of this rapidity we ought to be
able to detect some evidence of its existence.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>It is not so easy a thing to detect as you would
imagine. We have seen that it produces no
deviation or error in direction. Neither does it
cause any change of colour or Doppler effect;
that is, no shift of lines in spectrum. No steady
wind can affect pitch, simply because it cannot
blow waves to your ear more quickly than they are
emitted. It hurries them along, but it lengthens
them in the same proportion, and the result is
that they arrive at the proper frequency. The
precise effects of motion on pitch are summarised
in the following table:&mdash;</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Changes of Frequency due to Motion.</i></p>

<p>Source approaching shortens waves.</p>

<p>Receiver approaching alters relative velocity.</p>

<p>Medium flowing alters both wave-length and
velocity in exactly compensatory manner.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>What other phenomena may possibly result
from motion? Here is a list:&mdash;</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Phenomena resulting from Motion.</i></p>

<p>(1) Change or apparent change in direction;
observed by telescope, and called aberration.</p>

<p>(2) Change or apparent change in frequency; observed
by spectroscope, and called Doppler effect.</p>

<p>(3) Change or apparent change in time of
journey; observed by lag of phase or shift of
interference fringes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Change or apparent change in intensity;
observed by energy received by thermopile.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>What we have arrived at so far is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Motion of either source or receiver can alter
frequency; motion of receiver can alter apparent
direction; motion of the medium can do neither.</p>

<p>But the question must be asked, can it not hurry
a wave so as to make it arrive out of phase with
another wave arriving by a different path, and
thus produce or modify interference effects?</p>

<p>Or again, may it not carry the waves down
stream more plentifully than up stream, and
thus act on a pair of thermopiles, arranged fore
and aft at equal distances from a source, with
unequal intensity?</p>

<p>And once more, perhaps the laws of reflection
and refraction in a moving medium are not the
same as they are if it be at rest. Then, moreover,
there is double refraction, colours of thin
plates and thick plates, polarisation angle, rotation
of the plane of polarisation; all sorts of
optical phenomena that need consideration.</p>

<p>It may have to be admitted, perhaps, that in
empty space the effect of an ether drift is difficult
to detect, but will not the presence of dense
matter&mdash;especially the passage through dense
transparent matter&mdash;make the detection easier?
So a great number of questions arise, all of which
have been, from time to time, seriously discussed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><i>Interference.</i></p>

<p>As an instance of such discussion, consider
No. 3 of the phenomena tabulated above. I
expect that every reader understands interference,
but I may just briefly say that two
similar sets of waves "interfere" whenever and
wherever the crests of one set coincide with and
obliterate the troughs of the other set. Light
advances in any given direction when crests in
that direction are able to remain crests, and
troughs to remain troughs. But if we contrive
to split a beam of light into two halves, to send
them round by different paths, and make them
meet again, there is no guarantee that crest will
meet crest and trough trough; it may be just
the other way in some places, and wherever that
opposition of phase occurs there, there will be local
obliteration or "interference." Two reunited
half-beams of light may thus produce local stripes
of darkness, and these stripes are called interference
bands.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that there is any
<i>destruction</i> of light, or any dissipation of energy:
it is merely a case of redistribution.</p>

<p>The bright parts are brighter just in proportion
as the dark parts are darker. The screen is
illuminated in stripes and no longer uniformly,
but its total illumination is the same as if there
were no interference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Projection of Interference Bands.</span></p>

<p>It is not easy to project these interference
bands on a screen so as to make them visible
to an audience,&mdash;partly because the bands or
stripes of darkness are exceedingly narrow;
indeed I had not previously seen the experiment
attempted. But by means of what I call an
interference kaleidoscope, consisting of two
mirrors set at an angle with a third semi-transparent
mirror between them, it is possible to
get the bands remarkably clear and bright, so
that they can readily be projected: and I showed
these at a lecture to the Royal Institution of
Great Britain in 1892.</p>

<p>Each mirror is mounted on a tripod with
adjustable screw feet, which stand on a thick
iron slab, which again rests on hollow india-rubber
balls. Looking down on the mirrors the
plan is as in the diagram Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>, which indicates
sufficiently the geometry of the arrangement,
and shows that the two half-beams, into which
the semi-transparent plate divides the light, will
each travel round the same contour A B C in
opposite directions, and will then reunite and
travel together towards the point of the arrow.
A parallel beam from an electric lantern, when
thus treated, depicts bright and broad interference
bands on a screen. And the arrangement
is very little sensitive to disturbance, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the paths of the two halves of the beam are
identical, and because of the mounting. A
piece of good glass can be interposed without
disturbance, and the table can be struck a heavy
blow without confusing the bands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>
<img src="images/fig069.jpg" width="400" height="678" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 7. Plan of Interference Kaleidoscope with three mirrors.<br />

<small>The arrow-feather ray is bifurcated at A by a semi-transparent
mirror of thinly-silvered glass; and the two halves reunite along the
arrow-head after traversing a triangular contour A B C in opposite
directions. The simple geometrical relations which permit this are
sufficiently indicated in the figure. The arrangement would suit
Fizeau&#39;s experiment.</small></span>
</div>

<p>The only regular and orderly way of causing a
shift of the bands is to accelerate one half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
beam and to retard the other half, by moving a
transparent substance along the contour. For
instance, let the sides of the triangle A B C, or
one of them, consist of a tube of water in which
a rapid stream is maintained; then the stream
has a chance of accelerating one half the beam,
and retarding the other half, thereby shifting
the fringes from their normal position by a measurable
amount. This is the experiment made in
1859 by Fizeau. (Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>Now that most interesting and important, and
I think now well-known, experiment of Fizeau
proves quite simply and definitely that if light be
sent along a stream of water, travelling inside the
water as a transparent medium, it will go quicker
with the current than against it.</p>

<p>You may say that is only natural; a wind assists
sound one way and retards it the opposite way.
Yes, but then sound travels in air; and wind is a
bodily transfer of air; hence, of course, it gives the
sound a ride. Whereas light does not really travel
in water, but always in ether; and it is by no
means obvious whether a stream of water can help
or hinder it. Experiment decides, however, and
answers in the affirmative. It helps it along with
just about half the speed of the water; not with
the whole speed, which is curious and important,
and really means that the moving water has no
effect whatever on the ether of space, though we
must defer explaining how this comes about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Suffice for present purposes the fact that the
velocity of light inside moving water, and therefore
presumably inside all transparent matter, is
altered to some extent by motion of that matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a>
<img src="images/fig071.jpg" width="400" height="171" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 8. Hoek&#39;s arrangement.<br />

<small>The light from source S is reflected so as to travel half through
stagnant water and half through air on its direct journey, the path
being inverted on the return journey, after which it enters the eye.</small>
</span>
</div>
<p>Does not this fact afford an easy way of
detecting a motion of the earth through the
ether? Every vessel of stagnant water is really
travelling along through the ether at the rate of
nineteen miles a second. Send a beam of light
through it one way, and it will be hurried; its
velocity, instead of being 140,000 miles a second,
will be 140,009 miles. Send a beam of light the
other way, and its velocity will be 139,991; just as
much less. Bring these two beams together; surely
some of their wave-lengths will interfere. M.
Hoek, Astronomer at Utrecht, tried the experiment
in this very form; here is a diagram of his
apparatus (Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>). Babinet had tried another
form of the experiment previously. Hoek expected
to see interference bands, from the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
half-beams which had traversed the water, one
in the direction of the earth's motion and the
other against it. But no interference bands were
seen. The experiment gave a negative result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig9" id="fig9"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 9. Arrangement of Mascart and Jamin.<br />

<small>A modification of Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, with the beam split definitely into two halves
by reflexion from a thick glass plate and reunited before observation.
The two half-beams go through stagnant water in opposite directions.</small>
</span>
</div>

<p>An experiment, however, in which nothing is
seen is never a very satisfactory form of a negative
experiment; it is, as Mascart calls it, "doubly
negative," and we require some guarantee that
the conditions were right for seeing what might
really have been in some sort there. Hence
Mascart and Jamin's modification of the experiment
is preferable (Fig. <a href="#fig9">9</a>). The thing now looked
for is a shift of already existing interference bands,
when the above apparatus is turned so as to have
different aspects with respect to the earth's
motion; but no shift was seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Interference methods all fail to display any
trace of relative motion between earth and ether.</p>

<p>Try other phenomena then. Try refraction.
The index of refraction of glass is known to depend
on the ratio of the speed of light outside, to the
speed inside, the glass. If then the ether be
streaming through glass, the velocity of light
will be different inside according as it travels
with the stream or against it, and so the index of
refraction may be different. Arago was the first
to try this experiment by placing an achromatic
prism in front of a telescope on a mural circle,
and observing the deviation it produced on
stars.</p>

<p>Observe that it was an <i>achromatic</i> prism,
treating all wave-lengths alike; he looked at the
<i>deviated</i> image of a star, not at its <i>dispersed</i> image
or spectrum,&mdash;else he might have detected the
change-of-frequency-effect due to motion of source
or receiver first actually seen by Sir W. Huggins.
I do not think Arago would have seen it, because I
do not suppose his arrangements were delicate
enough for that very small effect; but there is no
error in the conception of his experiment, as Prof.
Mascart has inadvertently suggested there was.</p>

<p>Then Maxwell repeated the attempt in a much
more powerful manner, a method which could
have detected a very minute effect indeed, and
Mascart has also repeated it in a simple form.
All are absolutely negative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, then, what about aberration? If one looks
through a moving stratum, say a spinning glass
disk, there ought to be a shift caused by the motion
(see Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>). That particular experiment has not
been tried, but I entertain no doubt about its
result, though a high speed and considerable
thickness of glass or other medium would be necessary
to produce even a microscopic apparent
displacement of objects seen through it.</p>

<p>But the speed of the earth is available, and the
whole length of a telescope tube may be filled
with water; surely that is enough to displace
rays of light appreciably.</p>

<p>Sir George Airy tried it at Greenwich on a star,
with an appropriate zenith-sector full of water.
Stars were seen through the water-telescope
precisely as through an air telescope. A negative
result again! (The theory is fully dealt with in
Chapter <a href="#Page_127">X</a> and Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>Stellar observations, however, are unnecessarily
difficult. Fresnel had pointed out that a terrestrial
source of light would do just as well. He had
also (being a man of exceeding genius) predicted
that nothing would happen. Hoek has now tried
it in a perfect manner and nothing did happen.</p>

<p>But these facts are not at all disconcerting;
they are just what ought to be anticipated, in the
light of true theory. The absence of all effect
caused by stagnant dense matter inserted in the
path of a beam of light, that is of dense trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>parent
matter not artificially moved with reference
to the earth&mdash;or rather with reference to source
and receiver&mdash;is explicable on Fresnel's theory
concerning the behaviour of ether inside matter.</p>

<p>If the index of refraction of the matter is called
&#956;, that means that the speed of light inside it is
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>&#956;</sub>th of the speed outside or in vacuo. And that
is only another way of saying that the virtual
etherial density inside it is represented by &#956;²,
since the velocity of waves is inversely as the
square root of the density of the medium which
conveys them;&mdash;the elasticity being reckoned as
constant, and the same inside as out.</p>

<p>But then if the ether is incompressible its
density must really be constant,&mdash;so how can it
be denser inside matter than it is outside? The
answer is that presumably the ether is not really
extra dense, but is, as it were, <i>loaded</i> by the matter.
The atoms of matter, or the constituent electrons,
must be presumed to be shaken by the passage of
the waves of light, as they obviously are in fluorescent
substances; and accordingly the speed of
propagation will be lessened by the extra loading
which the waves encounter. It is not a real increase
of density, but a virtual increase, which
is really due to the addition of a certain fraction
of material inertia to the inertia of the ether itself.
The density of ether outside being 1, and that of
the loaded ether inside being &#956;², the effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
load is expressible as &#956;²&#8722;1, while the free ether is
the same inside as out.</p>

<p>Suppose now that the matter is moved along. The
extra loading, being part of the matter, of course
travels with it, and thereby affects the speed of light
to the extent of the load,&mdash;that is to say, by an
amount proportional to &#956;²&#8722;1 as contrasted with &#956;².</p>

<p>This is Fresnel's predicted ratio (&#956;²&#8722;1): &#956;², or
1 &#8722; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>&#956;²</sub>; and in Fizeau's experiment with running
water&mdash;especially as repeated later, with modern
accuracy, by Michelson&mdash;this represents exactly
the amount of observed effect upon the light.</p>

<p>But if, instead of running water, stagnant
water is used&mdash;that is stationary with respect
to the earth, though still moving violently through
the ether&mdash;then the (&#956;²&#8722;1) effect of the load will
be fixed to the matter, and can produce no extra
or motile effect. The only part that could produce
an effect of that kind would be the free ether,
of density 1. But then this&mdash;on the above view&mdash;is
absolutely stationary, not being carried along
by the earth at all; hence this can give no effect
either. Consequently the whole effect of an
ether-drift past the earth is zero, on optical experiments,
according to the theory of Fresnel;
and that is exactly what all the experiments just
described have confirmed.</p>

<p>Since then Prof. Mascart, with great pertinacity,
has attacked the phenomena of thick plates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Newton's rings, double refraction, and the rotatory
phenomenon of quartz; but he has found
absolutely nothing attributable to a stream of
ether past the earth.</p>

<p>The only positive result ever supposed to be
attained was in a very difficult polarisation
observation by Fizeau in 1859. Unless this has
been repeated, it is safest to ignore it; but I
believe that Lord Rayleigh has repeated it, and
obtained a negative result.</p>

<p>Fizeau also suggested, but did not attempt,
what seems an easier experiment, with fore and
aft thermopiles and a source between them, to
observe the drift of a medium by its convection of
energy; but arguments based on the law of exchanges<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
tend to show, and do show as I think,
that a probable alteration of radiating power due
to motion through a medium would just compensate
the effect otherwise to be expected.</p>

<p>We may summarise most of these statements
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I may say, then, that not a single optical phenomenon
is able to show the existence of an ether
stream near the earth. All optics go on precisely
as if the ether were stagnant with respect to the
earth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Well, then, perhaps it <i>is</i> stagnant. The experiments
I have quoted do not prove that it is so.
They are equally consistent with its perfect freedom
and with its absolute stagnation; though
they are not consistent with any intermediate
position. Certainly, if the ether were stagnant
nothing could be simpler than their explanation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The only phenomena then difficult to explain
would be those depending on light coming from
distant regions through all the layers of more or
less dragged ether. The theory of astronomical
aberration would be seriously complicated; in its
present form it would be upset (p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>). But it is
never wise to control facts by a theory; it is better
to invent some experiment that will give a different
result in stagnant and in free ether. None of
those experiments so far described are really
discriminative. They are, as I say, consistent
with either hypothesis, though not very obviously
so.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Michelson Experiment.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Michelson, however, of the United States,
invented a plan that looked as if it really would
discriminate; and, after overcoming many diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>culties,
he carried it out. It is described in the
<i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for 1887.</p>

<p>Michelson's famous experiment consists in
looking for interference between two half-beams
of light, of which one has been sent to and fro
<i>across</i> the line of ether drift, and the other has
been sent to and fro <i>along</i> the line of ether drift.</p>

<p>A semi-transparent mirror set at 45° is employed
to split the beam, and a pair of normal
and ordinary mirrors, set perpendicular to the two
half-beams, are employed to return them back
whence they came, so that they can enter the eye
through an observing telescope.</p>

<p>It differs essentially from the interference
kaleidoscope, Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>, inasmuch as there is now no
luminous path B C, and no contour enclosed by
the light. Each half-beam goes to and fro on
its own path, and these paths, instead of being
coincident, are widely separate,&mdash;one North and
South, for instance, and the other East and West.</p>

<p>Under these conditions the bands are much
more tremulous than they were in the arrangement
of Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>, and are subject to every kind of
disturbance. The apparatus has to be excessively
steady, and no fluctuation even of temperature
must be permitted in the path of either beam.
To secure this, the source, the mirrors, and the
observing telescope, were all mounted upon a
massive stone slab; and this was floated in a bath
of mercury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The slab could then be slowly turned round, so
that sometimes the path A B and sometimes the
path A C lay approximately along or athwart the
direction of the earth's motion in space.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as the motion along would take
a little longer than the motion across, though
everything else was accurately the same, some
shift of the interference bands might be expected
as the slab rotated.</p>

<p>But whereas in all the experiments previously
described the effect looked for was a first-order
effect, of magnitude one in ten or twenty thousand,&mdash;depending,
that is to say, on the first power of
the ratio of speed of earth to speed of light,&mdash;the
effect now to be expected depends on the <i>square</i>
of that same ratio, and therefore cannot be
greater, even in the most favourable circumstances,
than 1 part in a hundred million.</p>

<p>It is easy to realise therefore that it is an exceptionally
difficult experiment, and that it
required both skill and pertinacity to perform it
successfully.</p>

<p>That it is an exceptionally difficult experiment
will be realised when I say that it would fail in
conclusiveness unless one part in 400 millions
could be clearly detected.</p>

<p>Mr. Michelson reckons that by his latest arrangement
he could see 1 in 4000 millions if it existed
(which is equivalent to detecting an error of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>
of an inch in a length of 60 miles); but he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
nothing. Everything behaved precisely as if the
ether was stagnant; as if the earth carried with
it all the ether in its immediate neighbourhood.
And that was his conclusion.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Theory of Michelson Experiment.</i></p>

<p>The theory of the Michelson experiment can
be expressed thus: its optical diagram being the
same as is expressed geometrically in Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a>.</p>

<p>If a relatively fixed source and receiver move
through the ether with velocity <i>u</i>, such that <i>u</i>/<i>v</i>=&#945;
the aberration constant; then the time of any to
and fro journey S M, inclined at angle &#952; to the
direction of the drift, is increased, above what it
would be if there were no drift, in the ratio</p>

<p class="cen">&#8730;<span class="num">(1 &#8722; &#945;² sin² &#952;)</span> / <span class="denom">1 &#8722; &#945;²</span></p>

<p class="noin">This follows from merely geometrical considerations.</p>

<p>Hence if a ray is split, and half sent so that &#952;=0
while the other half is sent so that &#952;=90 (as in
Fig. <a href="#fig10">10</a>), the one will lag behind the other by a
distance &frac12;&#945;² times the distance travelled; which,
though very small, may be a perceptible fraction
of a wave-length, and therefore may cause a
perceptible shift of the bands.</p>

<p>But when the experiment is properly performed,
no such shift is observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The experiment thus seems to prove that there
is no motion through the ether at all, that there
is no etherial drift past the earth, that the ether
immediately in contact with the earth is stagnant&mdash;or
that the earth to that extent carries all neighbouring
ether with it.</p>

<p>If we wish to evade this conclusion, there is no
easy way of doing so. For it depends on no
doubtful properties of transparent substances,
but on the straightforward fundamental principle
underlying all such simple facts as that&mdash;It takes
longer to row a certain distance and back, up
and down stream, than it does to row the same
distance in still water; or that it takes longer to
run up and down a hill, than to run the same distance
laid out flat; or that it costs more to buy
a certain number of oranges at three a penny and
an equal number at two a penny than it does to
buy the whole lot at five for twopence.</p>

<p>Hence, although there may be <i>some</i> way of
getting round Mr. Michelson's experiment, there
is no obvious way; and if the true conclusion be
not that the ether near the earth is stagnant, it
must lead to some other important and unknown
fact.</p>

<p>That fact has now come clearly to light. It was
first suggested by the late Professor G.F. FitzGerald,
of Trinity College Dublin, while sitting
in my study at Liverpool and discussing the
matter with me. The suggestion bore the impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of truth from the first. It independently occurred
also to Professor H.A. Lorentz, of Leiden, into
whose theory it completely fits, and who has
brilliantly worked it into his system. It may be
explained briefly thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Electric charges in motion constitute an electric
current. Similar charges repel each other, but currents
in the same direction attract. Consequently
two similar charges moving in parallel lines will
repel each other less than if stationary,&mdash;less also
than if moving one after the other in the same line.
Likewise two opposite charges, a fixed distance apart,
attract each other less when moving side by side,
than when chasing each other. The modification of
the static force, thus caused, depends on the squared
ratio of their joint speed to the velocity of light.</p>

<p>Atoms of matter are charged; and cohesion is a
residual electric attraction (see end of Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_1">1</a>).
So when a block of matter is moving through the
ether of space its cohesive forces across the line of
motion are diminished, and consequently in that
direction it expands, by an amount proportioned to
the square of aberration magnitude.</p>

<p>A light journey, to and fro, across the path of a
relatively moving medium is slightly quicker than
the same journey, to and fro, along (see p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>).
But if the journeys are planned or set out on a block
of matter, they do not remain quite the same when
it is conveyed through space: the journey across the
direction of motion becomes longer than the other
journey, as we have just seen. And the extra distance
compensates or neutralises the extra speed;
so that light takes the same time for both.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>SPECIAL EXPERIMENT ON ETHERIAL<br />
VISCOSITY</h3>


<p class="cen"><span class="first">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> balance of evidence at this stage seems
to incline in the sense that there is no ether
drift, that the ether near the earth is stagnant,
that the earth carries all or the greater part of the
neighbouring ether with it,&mdash;a view which, if true,
must singularly complicate the theory of ordinary
astronomical aberration: as is explained at the
beginning of the last chapter.</p>

<p>But now put the question another way. <i>Can</i>
matter carry neighbouring ether with it when it
moves? Abandon the earth altogether; its
motion is very quick, but too uncontrollable, and
it always gives negative results. Take a lump of
matter that you can deal with, and see if it pulls
any ether along.</p>

<p>That is the experiment which I set myself to
perform, and which in the course of the years
1891-97 I performed. It may be thus described
in essence:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take a steel disk, or rather a couple of large steel
disks a yard in diameter clamped together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a space between. Mount the system on a vertical
axis, and spin it like a teetotum as fast as it will
stand without flying to pieces. Then take a
parallel beam of light, split it into two by a semi-transparent
mirror, M, a piece of glass silvered so
thinly that it lets half the light through and reflects
the other half, somewhat as in Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>; and send
the two halves of this split beam round and round
in opposite directions in the space between the
disks. They may thus travel a distance of 20 or
30 or 40 feet. Ultimately they are allowed to
meet and enter a telescope. If they have gone
quite identical distances they need not interfere,
but usually the distances will differ by a hundred-thousandth
of an inch or so, which is quite enough
to bring about interference.</p>

<p>The mirrors which reflect the light round and
round between the disks are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig11">11</a>.
If they form an accurate square the last two images
will coincide, but if the mirrors are the least inclined
to one another at any unaliquot part of
360° the last image splits into two, as in the
kaleidoscope is well known, and the interference
bands may be regarded as resulting from those
two sources. The central white band bisects
normally the distance between them, and their
amount of separation determines the width of
the bands. There are many interesting optical
details here, but I shall not go into them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a>
<img src="images/fig087.jpg" width="400" height="376" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 11. Diagrammatic Plan of Optical Frame for Ether
Machine; with Steel Disks, one yard in diameter, inside the
frame. The actual apparatus is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig14">14</a> and
Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a>.<br />
<small>M is a semi-transparent mirror, reflecting half an incident beam and
transmitting the other half. The two half-beams each go three times
round the square contour, in opposite directions, and then reunite.
It is an extension of the idea of Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>.</small>
</span>
</div>

<p>The thing to observe is whether the motion of the disks is able to replace a bright band by a dark
one, or vice versa. If it does, it means that one
of the half-beams, viz. that which is travelling in
the same direction as the disks, is helped on a trifle,
equivalent to a shortening of journey by some
quarter millionth of an inch or so in the whole
length of 30 feet; while the other half-beam, viz.
that travelling against the motion of the disks, is
retarded, or its path virtually lengthened, by the
same amount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>If this acceleration and retardation actually
occurs, waves which did not interfere on meeting
before the disks moved, will interfere now; for one
will arrive at the common goal half a length behind
the other.</p>

<p>Now a gradual change of bright space to dark,
and vice versa, shows itself, to an observer looking
at the bands, as a gradual change of position of
the bright stripes, or a shift of the bands. A shift
of the bands, and especially of the middle white
band, which is much more stable than the others,
is what we look for. The middle band is, or
should be, free from the "concertina"-like motion
which is liable to infect the others.</p>

<p>At first I saw plenty of shift. In the first
experiment the bands sailed across the field as
the disks got up speed until the crosswire had
traversed a band and a half. The conditions
were such that had the ether whirled at the full
speed of the disks I should have seen a shift of
three bands. It looked very much as if the light
was helped along at half the speed of the moving
matter, just as it is inside water.</p>

<p>On stopping the disks the bands returned to
their old position. On starting them again in
the opposite direction, the bands ought to have
shifted the other way too, if the effect was
genuine; but they did not; they went the same
way as before.</p>

<p>The shift was therefore wholly spurious; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was caused by the centrifugal force of the blast
of air thrown off from the moving disks. The
mirrors and frame had to be protected from this.
Many other small changes had to be made, and
gradually the spurious shifts have been reduced
and reduced, largely by the skill and patience of
my assistant, Mr. Benjamin Davies, until presently
there was barely a trace of them.</p>

<p>But the experiment is not an easy one. Not
only does the blast exert pressure, but at high
speeds the churning of the air makes it quite hot.
Moreover, the tremor of the whirling machine, in
which from four to nine horse-power is sometimes
being expended, is but too liable to communicate
itself to the optical part of the apparatus. Of
course elaborate precautions are taken against
this. Although the two parts, the mechanical and
the optical, are so close together, their supports are
entirely independent. But they have to rest on
the same earth, and hence communicated tremors
are not absent. They are the cause of most of
the slight residual trouble.</p>

<p>The whole experiment is described in fairly
full detail in the <i>Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society</i> for 1893 and 1897. And there also
are described some further modifications whereby
the whirling disks are electrified&mdash;likewise without
optical effect, and are also magnetised; or rather
a great iron mass, strongly magnetised by a
current, is used to replace the steel disks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect was always zero, however, when
spurious results were eliminated; and it is clear
that at no practicable speed does either electrification
or magnetisation confer upon matter any
appreciable viscous grip upon the ether. Atoms
<i>must</i> be able to throw it into vibration, if they
are oscillating or revolving at sufficient speed;
otherwise they would not emit light or any kind of
radiation; but in no case do they appear to drag
it along, or to meet with resistance in any uniform
motion through it. Only their acceleration is
effectual.</p>

<p>In the light of Larmor's electron theory, we
know now that acceleration of atoms, or rather of
a charge upon an atom, necessarily generates
radiation, proportional in amount to the <i>square</i> of
the acceleration&mdash;whether that be tangential or
normal. There is no theoretical reason for assuming
any influence on uniform velocity. And even
the influence on acceleration is exceedingly small
under ordinary circumstances. Only during the
violence of collision are ether waves freely
excited. The present experiment, however, has
nothing to do with acceleration: it is a test of
viscosity. An acceleration term exists in motion
through even a perfect fluid.</p>

<p>The conclusion at which I arrived in 1892 and
1893 is thus expressed (p. 777 of vol. 184 <i>Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society</i>):</p>

<blockquote><p>"I feel confident either that the ether between
the disks is quite unaffected by their motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or, if affected at all, by something less than
the thousandth part. At the same time, so far
as rigorous proof is concerned, I should prefer
to assert that <i>the velocity of light between two steel
plates moving together in their own plane an inch
apart is not increased or diminished by so much as
the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200</sub>th part of their velocity</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>That was the conclusion in 1893; but since
then observations have been continued, and it is
now quite safe to change the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200</sub>th into <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>th.
The spin was sometimes continued for three
hours to see if an effect developed with time;
and many other precautions were taken, as briefly
narrated in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
1897.</p>

<p>The following illustrations give an idea of the
apparatus employed.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig12">12</a> shows a photograph of the whirling
machine before being bolted down to its stone
pier; with the pair of disks at top ready to be
whirled by an armature on the shaft, which is
supplied with a current sometimes of nine horse-power.
The armature winding was of low resistance,
and was specially braced, so as to give
high speed without flying out, and without
generating too much back-E M F. The ampere-meter
and volt-meter and the carbon rheostat (in
armature circuit), for regulating the speed, are
plainly seen. The smooth pulley on the shaft is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for applying a brake. The small disk above it is
perforated to act as a siren for estimation of
speed; but other arrangements for this purpose
were subsequently added. The two large disks
at top were of the best circular-saw steel; they
are somewhat thicker at middle than at edge, and
are strongly bolted up between iron cheeks, which
are attached to the shaft. The lower end of the
shaft is a step-bearing of hardened steel in a vessel
of oil. The upper collar is elastic, so as to allow
for a steadying teetotum action at high speeds.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a> is a photograph of the optical square,
which was ultimately to be placed in position surrounding
the disks. The slit and collimator are
shown; the micrometer end of the observing
telescope is out of the picture.</p>

<p>The mirrors on the sides of the square are
accurately plane; they are adjustable on geometric
principles, and are pressed against their bearings by
strong spiral springs. They were made by Hilger.</p>

<p>A drawing of the arrangement is given in Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>,
and here the double micrometer eye-piece is
visible.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a> the whole apparatus is shown
mounted. The whirling machine strongly bolted
down to a stone pier independent of the floor;
the optical frame independently supported by a
gallows frame from other piers. The centrifugal
mercury speed-indicator is visible in front, and
Mr. Davies is regulating the speed. At the back
is seen a boiler-plate screen for the observer with
his eye at the telescope. (See <a href="#Frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span></p>

<p>The expense of the apparatus was borne by my
friend the late George Holt, shipowner, of Liverpool.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a> exhibits something like the appearance
seen in the eye-piece, with the interference bands
on each side of the middle band, and with the
micrometer wires set in position&mdash;each moved by
an independent micrometer head. The straight
vertical wire was usually set in the centre of the
middle white band, and the <b>X</b> wire on the yellow
of the first coloured band on one side or the other.</p>

<p>The method of observation now consists in
setting a wire of the micrometer accurately in
the centre of the middle band, while another
wire is usually set on the first band to the left.
Then the micrometer heads are read, and the
setting repeated once or twice to see how closely
and dependably they can be set in the same
position. Then we begin to spin the disks, and
when they are going at some high speed, measured
by a siren note and in other ways, the micrometer
wires are reset and read&mdash;reset several times and
read each time. Then the disks are stopped and
more readings are taken. Then their motion is
reversed, the wires set and read again; and finally
the motion is once more stopped and another set
of readings taken. By this means the absolute
shift of middle band, and its relative interpreta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>tion
in terms of wave-length, are simultaneously
obtained; for the distance from the one wire to
the other, which is often two revolutions of a
micrometer head, represents a whole wave-length
shift.</p>

<p>In the best experiments I do still often see
something like a fiftieth of a band shift; but it is
caused by residual spurious causes, for it repeats
itself with sufficient accuracy in the same direction
when the disks are spun the other way round.</p>

<p>Of real reversible shift, due to motion of the
ether, I see nothing. I do not believe the ether
moves. It does not move at a five-hundredth
part of the speed of the steel disks. Further
experience confirms and strengthens this estimate,
and my conclusion is that such things as circular
saws, flywheels, railway trains, and all ordinary
masses of matter do not appreciably carry the
ether with them. Their motion does not seem
to disturb it in the least.</p>

<p>The presumption is that the same is true for
the earth; but the earth is a big body,&mdash;it is conceivable
that so great a mass may be able to act
when a small mass would fail. I would not like
to be too sure about the earth&mdash;at least not on
a strictly experimental basis. What I do feel
sure of is that if moving matter disturbs ether in
its neighbourhood at all, it does so by some minute
action, comparable in amount perhaps to gravitation,
and possibly by means of the same property
as that to which gravitation is due&mdash;not by
anything that can fairly be likened to etherial
viscosity. So far as experiment has gone, our
conclusion is that the viscosity or fluid friction of
the ether is zero. And that is an entirely reasonable
conclusion.</p>

<p>For testing the effect of magnetism, an oblate
spheroid was made of specially selected soft iron,
3 feet in diameter, weighing nearly a ton. Its
section is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>. It had an annular
channel or groove, half an inch wide and 1 foot
deep, round the bottom of which was wound a
kilometre of insulated wire to a depth of 4&frac12; inches;
the terminals of which were brought out to sliding
contacts on the shaft, so that the whole could be
very highly magnetised while it was spinning.
Everything was arranged so as to be symmetrical
about the central axis.</p>

<p>To the coil of wire, whose resistance was 30
ohms, 110 volts was ordinarily, and 220 volts
exceptionally, applied. The magnetic field with
110 volts was about 1800 c.g.s., on the average,

of light circulated.</p>

<p>This light-bearing space, or gap in the magnetic
circuit, was only half an inch wide; and accordingly
in the eye-piece the iron surfaces could be seen,
above and below, as well as the interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
bands in the luminous gap. The whole appearance
is depicted in Fig. <a href="#fig18">18</a>.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Electrification.</span></p>

<p>For the electrification experiment, a third and
insulated disk was clamped between the two steel
disks and kept electrified to sparking tension.
The arrangement is shown diagrammatically on a
smaller scale in Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>.</p>

<p>The electrification test was exceptionally easy
to apply, by connecting the insulated charging pin
to a Voss machine in action: because when the
disks were spinning and the bands in good condition,
the electrification could be instantaneously
applied, taken off, reversed, or whatever was
desired; and the effect of the sudden lowering of
potential by sparks passing between the revolving

<p>The conclusion of my second <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> paper&mdash;that of 1897&mdash;is that <i>neither
an electric nor a magnetic transverse field confers
viscosity upon the ether, nor enables moving matter
to grip and move it rotationally</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Question of a Possible Longitudinal<br />

<p>Later I tried a longitudinal magnetic field also;
arranging a series of four large electric bobbins or
long coils along the sides of a square inscribed at
45° in the optical square, Figs. <a href="#fig11">11</a> and <a href="#fig13">13</a>; so that
the light went along their axes.</p>

<p>The details of this experiment have been only
partially recorded, but the salient points are to
be found stated in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for
April, 1907, pages 495-500.</p>

<p>The result was again negative; that is to say,
a magnetic field causes no perceptible acceleration
in a beam of light sent along the lines of force. The
extra velocity that could have been observed would
have been <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>th of a millimetre per second, or 16
miles per hour, for each C.G.S. unit of field intensity.</p>

<p>Another mode of expressing the result is that
the difference of magnetic potential applied,
namely, a drop of two million C.G.S. units of
magnetic potential, does not hurry light along it by
so much as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th part of a wave-length.</p>

<p>There may be reasons for supposing that some
much slower drift or conveyance than this is
really caused in the ether by a magnetic field;
but if so, the ether must be regarded as so excessively
dense that the amount of such a drift for
any practicable magnetic field seems almost hopelessly
beyond experimental means of detection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ETHERIAL DENSITY</h3>


<p>This leads us to enter upon the question of
whether it is possible to determine with any
approach to accuracy the actual density or massiveness
of the ether of space, compared with those
forms of matter to which our senses have made
us accustomed.</p>

<p>The arguments on which an estimate may be
made of the density or massiveness of the ether
as compared with that of matter depend on the
following considerations, the validity of which
again is dependent upon an electrical theory of
matter. In this theory, or working hypothesis,
an assumption has to be made: but it is one for
which there is a large amount of justification, and
the reasons for it are given in many books,&mdash;among
others in my book on <i>Electrons</i>, and likewise
at the end of the new edition of <i>Modern Views
of Electricity</i>, also in my <i>Romanes Lecture</i>, published
by the Clarendon Press in 1903. Put
briefly, the assumption is that matter is composed,
in some way or other, of electrons; which
again must be considered to be essentially pecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>liarities,
or singularities, or definite structures, in
the ether itself. Indeed, a consideration of
electrons alone is sufficient for the argument,
provided it be admitted that they have the mass
which experiment shows them to possess, and the
size which electrical theory deduces for them:
the basis of the idea&mdash;which, indeed, is now experimentally
proved&mdash;being that their inertia is due
to their self-induction,&mdash;i.e. to the magnetic field
with which they must be surrounded as long as
they are in motion.</p>

<p>The mass, or inertia, of an electron is comparable
to the thousandth part of that of the atom
of hydrogen. Its linear dimension, let us say its
diameter, is comparable to the one-hundred-thousandth
part of what is commonly known as
molecular or atomic dimension; which itself is
the ten-millionth part of a millimetre.</p>

<p>Hence, the mass and the bulk of an electron
being known, its density is determined, provided
we can assume that its mass is all dependent on
what is contained within its periphery. But that
last assumption is one that quite definitely cannot
be made: its mass is for the most part outside
itself, and has to be calculated by magnetic
considerations. (See Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_2">2</a>.)</p>

<p>These details are gone into in my paper in the
<i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for April, 1907, and in
Chapter XVII of <i>Modern Views of Electricity</i>. But
without repeating arguments here, it will suffice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
say that although the estimates may be made in
various ways, differing entirely from each other,
yet the resulting differences are only slight; the
calculated densities come out all of the same
order of magnitude, namely, something comparable
to 10<sup>12</sup> C.G.S. units,&mdash;that is to say, a million
million grammes per cubic centimetre, or, in other
words, a thousand tons to the cubic millimetre.</p>

<p>But, throughout, we have seen reason to assert
that the ether is incompressible; arguments for
this are given in <i>Modern Views of Electricity</i>,
Chapter I. And, indeed, the fundamental medium
filling all space, if there be such, <i>must</i>, in my
judgment, be ultimately incompressible; otherwise
it would be composed of parts, and we should
have to seek for something still more fundamental
to fill the interstices.</p>

<p>The ether being incompressible, and an electron
being supposed composed simply and solely of
ether, it follows that it cannot be either a condensation
or a rarefaction of that material, but
must be some singularity of structure, or some
portion otherwise differentiated. It might, for
instance, be something analogous to a vortex ring,
differentiated kinetically, i.e. by reason of its
rotational motion, from the remainder of the
ether; or it might be differentiated statically,
and be something which would have to be called
a strain-centre or a region of twist, or something
which cannot be very clearly at present imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with any security; though various suggestions
have been made in that direction.</p>

<p>The simplest plan for us is to think of it somewhat
as we think of a knot on a piece of string.
The knot differs in no respect from the rest of the
string, except in its tied-up structure; it is of the
same density with the rest, and yet it is differentiated
from the rest; and, in order to cease to be
a knot, would have to be untied&mdash;a process which
as yet we have not learned how to apply to
an electron. If ever such a procedure becomes
possible, then electrons will thereby be resolved
into the general body of the undifferentiated ether
of space,&mdash;that part which is independent of what
we call "matter."</p>

<p>The important notion for present purposes is
merely this: that the density of the undifferentiated
or simple ether, and the density of the
tied-up or be-knotted or otherwise modified
ether constituting an electron, are one and the
same. Hence the argument above given, at least
when properly worked out, tends to establish the
etherial density as of the order 10<sup>12</sup> times that of
water.</p>

<p>There ought to be nothing surprising (though
I admit that there is something very surprising)
in such an estimate; inasmuch as many converging
lines of argument tend to show that ordinary
matter is a very porous or gossamer-like substance,
with interspaces great as compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the spaces actually occupied by the nuclei which
constitute it. Our conception of matter, if it is
to be composed of electrons, is necessarily rather
like the conception of a solar system, or rather
of a milky way; where there are innumerable
dots here and there, with great interspaces between.
So that the average density of the whole
of the dots or material particles taken together,&mdash;that
is to say, their aggregate mass compared with
the space they occupy,&mdash;is excessively small.</p>

<p>In the vast extent of the Cosmos, as a whole,
the small bulk of actual matter, compared with
the volume of empty space, is striking&mdash;as we
shall show directly; and now on the small scale,
among the atoms of matter, we find the conditions
to be similar. Even what we call the
densest material is of extraordinarily insignificant
massiveness as compared with the unmodified
ether which occupies by far the greater proportion
of its bulk.</p>

<p>When we speak of the density of <i>matter</i>, we
are really though not consciously expressing the
group-density of the modified ether which constitutes
matter,&mdash;not estimated per unit, but
per aggregate; just as we might estimate the
group or average density of a cloud or mist.
Reckoned per unit, a cloud has the density of
water; reckoned per aggregate, it is an impalpable
filmy structure of hardly any density at all. So it
is with a cobweb, so perhaps it is with a comet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tail, so also with the Milky Way, with the
cosmos,&mdash;and, as it now turns out, with ordinary
matter itself.</p>

<p>For consider the average density of the material
cosmos. It comes out almost incredibly small.
In other words, the amount of matter in space,
compared with the volume of space it occupies,
is almost infinitesimal. Lord Kelvin argues that
ultimately it must be really infinitesimal (<i>Philosophical
Magazine</i>, Aug., 1901, and Jan., 1902),
that is to say that the volume of space is
infinitely greater than the total bulk of matter
which it contains. Otherwise the combined force
of gravity&mdash;or at least the aggregate gravitational
potential&mdash;on which the velocity generated in
material bodies ultimately depends, would be far
greater than observation shows it to be.</p>

<p>The whole visible universe, within a parallax of
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> second of arc, is estimated by Lord Kelvin
as the equivalent of a thousand million of our
suns; and this amount of matter, distributed as
it is, would have an average density of 1·6 × 10<sup>&#8722;23</sup>
grammes per c.c. It is noteworthy how exceedingly
small is this average or aggregate density of
matter in the visible region of space. The estimated
density of 10<sup>&#8722;23</sup> c.g.s. means that the
visible cosmos is as much rarer than a "vacuum"
of a hundred millionths of an atmosphere, as that
vacuum is itself rarer than lead.</p>

<p>It is because we have reason to assert that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ordinary mass of matter consists, like the cosmos,
of separated particles, with great intervening
distances in proportion to their size, that we are
able to maintain that the aggregate density of
ordinary stuff, such as water or lead, is very small
compared with the continuous medium in which
they exist, and of which all particles are supposed
to be really composed. So that lead is to the
ether, as regards density, very much as the
"vacuum" above spoken of is to lead. The
fundamental medium itself must be of uniform
density everywhere, whether materialised or free.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FURTHER EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING<br />
THE DENSITY AND ENERGY OF THE ETHER</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">A</span> <span class="smcap">reader</span> may suppose that in speaking of
the immense density or massiveness of ether,
and the absurdly small density or specific gravity
of gross matter by comparison, I intend to signify
that matter is a <i>rarefaction</i> of the ether. That,
however, is not my intention. The view I advocate
is that the ether is a perfect <i>continuum</i>, an
absolute <i>plenum</i>, and that therefore no rarefaction
is possible. The ether inside matter is just as
dense as the ether outside, and no denser. A
material unit&mdash;say an electron&mdash;is only a peculiarity
or singularity of some kind in the ether
itself, which is of perfectly uniform density
everywhere. What we "sense" as matter is an
aggregate or grouping of an enormous number
of such units.</p>

<p>How then can we say that matter is millions of
times rarer or less substantial than the ether of
which it is essentially composed? Those who
feel any difficulty here, should bethink themselves
of what they mean by the average or aggregate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
density of any discontinuous system, such as a
powder, or a gas, or a precipitate, or a snowstorm,
or a cloud, or a milky way.</p>

<p>If it be urged that it is unfair to compare an
obviously discrete assemblage like the stars, with
an apparently continuous substance like air or
lead,&mdash;the answer is that it is entirely and accurately
fair; since air, and every other known
form of matter, is essentially an aggregate of
particles, and since it is always their average
density that we mean. We do not even know for
certain their individual atomic density.</p>

<p>The phrase "specific gravity or density of a
powder" is ambiguous. It may mean the specific
gravity of the dry powder as it lies, like snow;
or it may mean the specific gravity of the particles
of which it is composed, like ice.</p>

<p>So also with regard to the density of matter, we
might mean the density of the fundamental
material of which its units are made&mdash;which
would be ether; or we might, and in practice do,
mean the density of the aggregate lump which we
can see and handle; that is to say, of water or
iron or lead, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In saying that the density of matter is small,&mdash;I
mean, of course, in the last, the usual, sense.
In saying that the density of ether is great,&mdash;I
mean that the actual stuff of which these highly
porous aggregates are composed is of immense, of
wellnigh incredible, density. It is only another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
way of saying that the ultimate units of matter are
few and far between&mdash;i.e. that they are excessively
small as compared with the distances between
them; just as the planets of the solar system, or
worlds in the sky, are few and far between,&mdash;the
intervening distances being enormous as compared
with the portions of space actually occupied
by lumps of matter.</p>

<p>It may be noted that it is not unreasonable to
argue that the density of a <i>continuum</i> is necessarily
greater than the density of any disconnected
aggregate: certainly of any assemblage whose
particles are actually composed of the material of
the <i>continuum</i>. Because the former is "all there,"
everywhere, without break or intermittence of
any kind; while the latter has gaps in it,&mdash;it is
here, and there, but not everywhere.</p>

<p>Indeed, this very argument was used long ago
by that notable genius Robert Hooke, and I quote
a passage which Professor Poynting has discovered
in his collected posthumous works and kindly
copied out for me:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"As for <i>matter</i>, that I conceive in its essence to
be immutable, and its essence being expatiation
determinate, it cannot be altered in its quantity,
either by condensation or rarefaction; that is,
there cannot be more or less of that power or
reality, whatever it be, within the same expatiation
or content; but every equal expatiation
contains, is filled, or is an equal quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>materia</i>; and the densest or heaviest, or most
powerful body in the world contains no more
materia than that which we conceive to be the
rarest, thinnest, lightest, or least powerful body
of all; as gold for instance, and <i>æther</i>, or the
substance that fills the cavity of an exhausted
vessel, or cavity of the glass of a barometer above
the quicksilver. Nay, as I shall afterwards prove,
this cavity is more full, or a more dense body of
æther, in the common sense or acceptation of the
word, than gold is of gold, bulk for bulk; and
that because the one, viz. the mass of æther, is all
æther: but the mass of gold, which we conceive,
is not all gold; but there is an intermixture, and
that vastly more than is commonly supposed, of
æther with it; so that vacuity, as it is commonly
thought, or erroneously supposed, is a more dense
body than the gold as gold. But if we consider
the whole content of the one with that of the other,
within the same or equal quantity of expatiation,
then are they both equally containing the <i>materia</i>
or body."&mdash;[<i>From the Posthumous Works of Robert
Hooke, M.D., F.R.S., 1705, pp. 171-2</i> (<i>as copied
in Memoir of Dalton, by Angus Smith</i>).]</p></blockquote>

<p>Newton's contemporaries did not excel in power
of clear expression, as he himself did; but Professor
Poynting interprets this singular attempt at
utterance thus:&mdash;"All space is filled with equally
dense <i>materia</i>. Gold fills only a small fraction of
the space assigned to it, and yet has a big mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
How much greater must be the total mass filling
that space."</p>

<p>The tacit assumption here made is that the
particles of the aggregate are all composed of one
and the same continuous substance,&mdash;practically
that matter is made of ether; and that assumption,
in Hooke's day, must have been only a
speculation. But it is the kind of speculation which
time is justifying, it is the kind of truth which
we all feel to be in process of establishment now.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>We do not depend on that sort of argument,
however; what we depend on is experimental
measure of the mass, and mathematical estimate
of the volume, of the electron. For calculation
shows that however the mass be accounted for&mdash;whether
electrostatically or magnetically, or hydrodynamically&mdash;the
estimate of ratio of mass to
effective volume can differ only in a numerical
coefficient, and cannot differ as regards order of
magnitude. The only way out of this conclusion
would be the discovery that the negative
electron is not the real or the main matter-unit,
but is only a subsidiary ingredient; whereas
the main mass is the more bulky positive
charge. That last hypothesis however is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
present too vague to be useful. Moreover, the
mass of such a charge would in that case be unexplained,
and would need a further step; which
would probably land us in much the same sort of
etherial density as is involved in the estimate
which I have based on the more familiar and
tractable negative electron. (See Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_2">2</a>.)</p>

<p>It may be said why assume any finite density
for the ether at all? Why not assume that, as it
is infinitely continuous, so it is infinitely dense&mdash;whatever
that may mean&mdash;and that all its properties
are infinite? This might be possible were it
not for the velocity of light. By transmitting
waves at a finite and measurable speed, the ether
has given itself away, and has let in all the possibilities
of calculation and numerical statement.
Its properties are thereby exhibited as essentially
finite&mdash;however infinite the whole extent of it
may turn out to be. Parenthetically we may
remark that "gravitation" has not yet exhibited
any similar kind of finite property; and that is
why we know so little about it.</p>


<p class="cen">ETHERIAL ENERGY.</p>

<p>Instead then of saying that the density of the
ether is great, the clearest mode of expression
is to say that the density of matter is small.
Just as we can say that the density of the visible
cosmos is small, although in individual lumps its
density is comparable to that of iron or rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>At the risk of repetition, I have explained this
over again, because it is a matter on which confusion
may easily arise. The really important
thing about ether is not so much its density,
considered in itself, as the energy which that
density necessarily involves, on any kinetic theory
of its elasticity. For it is not impossible&mdash;however
hopeless it may seem now&mdash;that a modicum
of that energy may some day be partially utilised.</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin's incipient kinetic theory of elasticity
is a complicated matter, and I will only
briefly enter upon it. But before doing so,
I want to remove an objection which is sometimes
felt, as to the fluid and easily permeable
character of a medium of this great density,&mdash;that
is to say, as to the absence of friction or
viscosity&mdash;the absence of resistance to bodies
moving through it. As a matter of fact there
is no necessary connexion whatever between
density and viscosity.</p>

<p>'Density' and 'Viscosity' are entirely different
things; and, if there is no fluid friction, a fluid
may have any density you please without interposing
any obstacle to constant velocity. To
<i>acceleration</i> it does indeed oppose an obstacle,
but that appears as essentially a part of the inertia
or massiveness of the moving body. It contributes
to its momentum; and, if the fluid is
everywhere present, it is impossible to discriminate
between, or to treat separately, that part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
inertia which belongs to the fluid displaced, and
that part which belongs to the body moving
through it,&mdash;except by theory.</p>

<p>As for the elasticity of the ether, that is ascertainable
at once from the speed at which it transmits
waves. That speed&mdash;the velocity of light&mdash;is
accurately known, 3 × 10<sup>10</sup> centimetres per
second. And the ratio of the elasticity or rigidity
to the density is equal to the square of this speed;&mdash;that
is to say, the elasticity must be 9 × 10<sup>20</sup>
times the density; or, in other words, 10<sup>33</sup> C.G.S.
units. That is an immediate consequence of the
estimate of density and the fact of the velocity of
light; and if the density is admitted, the other
cannot be contested.</p>

<p>But we must go on to ask, To what is this rigidity
due? If the ether does not consist of parts, and
if it is fluid, how can it possess the rigidity appropriate
to a solid, so as to transmit transverse
waves? To answer this we must fall back upon
Lord Kelvin's kinetic theory of elasticity:&mdash;that
it must be due to rotational motion&mdash;intimate
fine-grained motion throughout the whole etherial
region&mdash;motion not of the nature of locomotion,
but circulation in closed curves, returning upon
itself,&mdash;vortex motion of a kind far more finely
grained than any waves of light or any atomic
or even electronic structure.</p>

<p>Now if the elasticity of any medium is to be
thus explained kinetically, it follows, as a neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>sary
consequence, that the speed of this internal
motion must be comparable to the speed of wave
propagation;&mdash;that is to say that the internal
squirming circulation, to which every part of the
ether is subject, must be carried on with a velocity of
the same order of magnitude as the velocity of light.</p>

<p>This is the theory then,&mdash;this theory of elasticity
as dependent on motion,&mdash;which, in combination
with the estimate of density, makes the
internal energy of the ether so gigantic. For in
every cubic millimetre of space we have, according
to this view, a mass equivalent to what, if it
were matter, we should call a thousand tons,
circulating internally, every part of it, with a
velocity comparable to the velocity of light, and
therefore containing&mdash;stored away in that small
region of space&mdash;an amount of energy of the order
10<sup>29</sup> ergs, or, what is the samething, 3 × 10<sup>11</sup> kilowatt
centuries; which is otherwise expressible as
equal to the energy of a million horse-power station
working continuously for forty million years.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Summarised Brief Statements concerning<br />
the Ether</span></p>

<p class="cen"><i>(As communicated by the author to the British Association<br />
at Leicester, 1907).</i></p>

<p>1. The theory that an electric charge must
possess the equivalent of inertia was clearly
established by J.J. Thomson in the <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> for April, 1881.</p>

<p>2. The discovery of masses smaller than atoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was made experimentally by J.J. Thomson, and
communicated to Section A at Dover in 1899.</p>

<p>3. The thesis that the corpuscles so discovered
consisted wholly of electric charges was sustained
by many people, and was clinched by the experiments
of Kaufmann in 1902.</p>

<p>4. The concentration of the ionic charge,
required to give the observed corpuscular inertia,
can be easily calculated; and consequently the
size of the electric nucleus, or electron, is known.</p>

<p>5. The old perception that a magnetic field is
kinetic has been developed by Kelvin, Heaviside,
FitzGerald, Hicks, and Larmor, most of whom
have treated it as a flow along magnetic lines;
though it may also, perhaps equally well, be
regarded as a flow perpendicular to them and
along the Poynting vector. The former doctrine
is sustained by Larmor, as in accordance with the
principle of Least Action, and with the absolutely
stationary character of the ether as a whole; the
latter view appears to be more consistent with
the theories of J.J. Thomson.</p>

<p>6. A charge in motion is well known to be surrounded
by a magnetic field; and the energy of
the motion can be expressed in terms of the energy
of this concomitant field,&mdash;which again must be
accounted as the kinetic energy of ethereous flow.</p>

<p>7. Putting these things together, and considering
the ether as essentially incompressible&mdash;on
the strength of the Cavendish electric experiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the facts of gravitation, and the general idea of
a connecting continuous medium&mdash;the author
reckons that to deal with the ether dynamically
it must be treated as having a density of the order
10<sup>12</sup> grammes per cubic centimetre. (See Appendix
<a href="#APPENDIX_2">2</a>.)</p>

<p>8. The existence of transverse waves in the
interior of a fluid can only be explained on gyrostatic
principles, i.e. by the kinetic or rotational
elasticity of Lord Kelvin. And the internal
circulatory speed of the intrinsic motion of such
a fluid must be comparable with the velocity with
which such waves are transmitted.</p>

<p>9. Putting these things together, it follows that
the intrinsic or constitutional vortex energy of
the ether must be of the order 10<sup>33</sup> ergs per cubic
centimetre.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;Thus every cubic millimetre of
the universal ether of space must possess the
equivalent of a thousand tons, and every part of
it must be squirming internally with the velocity
of light.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>ETHER AND MATTER</h3>


<p class="cen">THE MECHANICAL NECESSITY FOR A CONTINUOUS<br />
MEDIUM FILLING SPACE</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="first">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> this chapter I propose to summarise in simple
and consecutive form most of the arguments
already used. Thirty years ago Clerk Maxwell
gave to the Royal Institution of Great Britain a
remarkable address on "Action at a Distance."
It is reported in the Journal R.I., Vol. VII, and
to it I would direct attention. Most natural
philosophers hold, and have held, that action at
a distance across empty space is impossible; in
other words, that matter cannot act where it is
not, but only where it is. The question "Where
is it?" is a further question that may demand
attention and require more than a superficial
answer. For it can be argued on the hydrodynamic
or vortex theory of matter, as well
as on the electrical theory, that every atom of
matter has a universal though nearly infinitesimal
prevalence, and extends everywhere;
since there is no definite sharp boundary or limiting
periphery to the region disturbed by its
existence. The lines of force of an isolated electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
charge extend throughout illimitable space. And
though a charge of opposite sign will curve and
concentrate them, yet it is possible to deal with
both charges, by the method of superposition, as
if they each existed separately without the other.</p>

<p>In that case, therefore, however far they reach,
such nuclei clearly exert no "action at a distance"
in the technical sense.</p>

<p>Some philosophers have reason to suppose that
mind can act directly on mind without intervening
mechanism,&mdash;and sometimes that has been
spoken of as genuine action at a distance; but
no proper conception or physical model can
be made of such a process, nor is it clear that
"space" and "distance" have any particular
meaning in the region of psychology. The links
between mind and mind may be something quite
other than physical proximity; and in denying
action at a distance across empty space I am not
denying telepathy or other activities of a non-physical
kind. For although brain disturbance is
certainly physical, and is an essential concomitant
of mental action whether of the sending or
receiving variety, yet we know from the case of
heat that a material movement can be excited
in one place at the expense of corresponding movement
in another, without any similar kind of
transmission or material connexion between the
two places: the thing that travels across vacuum
is not heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>In all cases where physical motion is involved,
however, I would have a medium sought for. It
may not be matter, but it must be something;
there must be a connecting link of some kind, or
the transference cannot occur. There can be no
attraction across really empty space. And even
when a material link exists, so that the connexion
is obvious, the explanation is not complete; for
when the mechanism of attraction is understood,
it will be found that a body really only moves
because it is pushed by something from behind.
The essential force in nature is the <i>vis a tergo</i>. So
when we have found the "traces," or discovered
the connecting thread, we still run up against the
word "cohesion"; and we ought to be exercised
in our minds as to its ultimate meaning. Why the
whole of a rod should follow, when one end is
pulled, is a matter requiring explanation; and
the only explanation that can be given involves,
in some form or other, a continuous medium connecting
the discrete and separated particles or
atoms of matter.</p>

<p>When a steel spring is bent or distorted, what
is it that is really strained? Not the atoms&mdash;the
atoms are only displaced; it is the connecting
links that are strained&mdash;the connecting medium&mdash;the
ether. Distortion of a spring is really distortion
of the ether. All stress exists in the ether.
Matter can only be moved. Contact does not
exist between the atoms of matter as we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
them; it is doubtful if a piece of matter ever
touches another piece, any more than a comet
touches the sun when it appears to rebound from
it; but the atoms are connected, as the comet
and the sun are connected, by a continuous
<i>plenum</i> without break or discontinuity of any
kind. Matter acts on matter only through the
ether. But whether matter is a thing utterly
distinct and separate from the ether, or whether
it is a specifically modified portion of it&mdash;modified
in such a way as to be susceptible of locomotion
and yet continuous with all the rest of the ether,
which can be said to extend everywhere far
beyond the bounds of the modified and tangible
portion&mdash;are questions demanding, and I may say
in process of receiving, answers.</p>

<p>Every such answer involves some view of the
universal and possibly infinite uniform omnipresent
connecting medium, the Ether of space.</p>

<p>It has been said, somewhat sarcastically, that
the ether was made in England. The statement
is only an exaggeration of the truth. I might even
urge that it has been largely constructed in the
Royal Institution; for, I will summarise now the
chief lines of evidence on which its existence is
believed in, and our knowledge of it is based.</p>

<p>First of all, Newton recognised the need of a
medium for explaining gravitation. In his
"Optical Queries" he shows that if the pressure
of this medium is less in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
dense bodies than at great distances from them,
dense bodies will be driven towards each other;
and that if the diminution of pressure is inversely
as the distance from the dense body, the law of
force will be the inverse square law of gravitation.</p>

<p>All that is required, therefore, to explain
gravity, is a diminution of pressure, or increase of
tension, caused by the formation of a matter unit&mdash;that
is to say of an electron or corpuscle. And
although we do not yet know what an electron is&mdash;whether
it be a strain centre, or what kind of
singularity in the ether it may be&mdash;there is no
difficulty in supposing that a slight, almost
infinitesimal, strain or attempted rarefaction
should be produced in the ether whenever an
electron comes into being&mdash;to be relaxed again only
on its resolution and destruction. Strictly speaking
it is not a real <i>strain</i>, but only a "stress";
since there can be no actual <i>yield</i>, but only a pull
or tension, extending in all directions towards
infinity.</p>

<p>The tension required per unit of matter is
almost ludicrously small, and yet in the aggregate,
near such a body as a planet, it becomes enormous.</p>

<p>The force with which the moon is held in its
orbit would be great enough to tear asunder a
steel rod four hundred miles thick, with a tenacity
of 30 tons per square inch; so that if the moon
and earth were connected by steel instead of by
gravity, a forest of pillars would be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
whirl the system once a month round their common
centre of gravity. Such a force necessarily implies
enormous tension or pressure in the medium.
Maxwell calculates that the gravitational stress
near the earth, which we must suppose to exist in
the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than
what the strongest steel could stand; and near
the sun it should be 2500 times as great as that.</p>

<p>The question has arisen in my mind, whether,
if the whole sensible universe&mdash;estimated by Lord
Kelvin as equivalent to about a thousand million
suns&mdash;were all concentrated in one body of
specifiable density,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the stress would not be so
great as to produce a tendency towards etherial
disruption; which would result in a disintegrating
explosion, and a scattering of the particles
once more as an enormous nebula and other
fragments into the depths of space. For the
tension would be a maximum in the interior of
such a mass; and, if it rose to the value 10<sup>33</sup> dynes
per square centimetre, something would have
to happen. I do not suppose that this can be the
reason, but one would think there must be <i>some</i>
reason, for the scattered condition of gravitative
matter.</p>

<p>Too little is known, however, about the mechanism
of gravitation to enable us to adduce it as
the strongest argument in support of the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of an ether. The oldest valid and conclusive
requisition of an ethereous medium depends on the
wave theory of light, one of the founders of which
was the Royal Institution Professor of Natural
Philosophy at the beginning of last century,
Dr. Thomas Young.</p>

<p>No ordinary matter is capable of transmitting
the undulations or tremors that we call light.
The speed at which they go, the kind of undulation,
and the facility with which they go through
vacuum, forbid this.</p>

<p>So clearly and universally has it been perceived
that waves must be waves of something&mdash;something
distinct from ordinary matter&mdash;that Lord
Salisbury, in his presidential address to the
British Association at Oxford, criticised the ether
as little more than a nominative case to the verb
to undulate. It is truly <i>that</i>, though it is also
truly more than that; but to illustrate that
luminiferous aspect of it, I will quote a paragraph
from the lecture of Clerk Maxwell's to which I
have already referred:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The vast interplanetary and interstellar regions
will no longer be regarded as waste places in the
universe, which the Creator has not seen fit to fill
with the symbols of the manifold order of His
kingdom. We shall find them to be already full
of this wonderful medium; so full, that no human
power can remove it from the smallest portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite
continuity. It extends unbroken from star to
star; and when a molecule of hydrogen vibrates
in the dog-star, the medium receives the impulses
of these vibrations, and after carrying them in
its immense bosom for several years, delivers
them, in due course, regular order, and full tale,
into the spectroscope of Mr. Huggins, at Tulse
Hill."</p></blockquote>

<p>This will suffice to emphasise the fact that the
eye is truly an etherial sense-organ&mdash;the only
one which we possess, the only mode by which the
ether is enabled to appeal to us; and that the
detection of tremors in this medium&mdash;the perception
of the direction in which they go, and some
inference as to the quality of the object which
has emitted them&mdash;cover all that we mean by
"sight" and "seeing."</p>

<p>I pass then to another function, the electric
and magnetic phenomena displayed by the ether;
and on this I will only permit myself a very short
quotation from the writings of Faraday, whose
whole life may be said to have been directed towards
a better understanding of these ethereous
phenomena. Indeed the statue in the entrance
hall of the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street,
may be considered as the statue of the discoverer
of the electric and magnetic properties of the
Ether of space.</p>

<p>Faraday conjectured that the same medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
which is concerned in the propagation of light
might also be the agent in electromagnetic phenomena.
"For my own part," he says, "considering
the relation of a vacuum to the magnetic force,
and the general character of magnetic phenomena
external to the magnet, I am much more inclined
to the notion that in the transmission of the force
there is such an action, external to the magnet,
than that the effects are merely attraction and
repulsion at a distance. Such an action may be a
function of the æther; for it is not unlikely that,
if there be an æther, it should have other uses
than simply the conveyance of radiation."</p>

<p>This conjecture has been amply strengthened
by subsequent investigations.</p>

<p>One more function is now being discovered;
the ether is being found to constitute matter&mdash;an
immensely interesting topic, on which there are
many active workers at the present time. I will
make a brief quotation from Professor Sir J.J.
Thomson, where he summarises the conclusion
which we all see looming before us, though it has
not yet been completely attained, and would not
by all be similarly expressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <i>whole</i> mass of any body is just the mass
of ether surrounding the body which is carried
along by the Faraday tubes associated with the
atoms of the body. In fact, all mass is mass of
the ether; all momentum, momentum of the
ether; and all kinetic energy, kinetic energy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the ether. This view, it should be said, requires
the density of the ether to be immensely greater
than that of any known substance."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, far denser&mdash;so dense that matter by comparison
is like gossamer, or a filmy imperceptible
mist, or a milky way. Not unreal or unimportant,&mdash;a
cobweb is not unreal, nor to certain creatures
is it unimportant, but it cannot be said to be
massive or dense; and matter, even platinum,
is not dense when compared with the ether. Not
till last year, however, did I realise what the
density of the ether must really be,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> compared
with that modification of it which appeals to our
senses as matter, and which for that reason engrosses
our attention.</p>

<p>Is there any other function possessed by the
ether, which, though not yet discovered, may lie
within the bounds of possibility for future discovery?
I believe there is, but it is too speculative
to refer to, beyond saying that it has been
urged as probable by the authors of <i>The Unseen
Universe</i>, and has been thus tentatively
referred to by Clerk Maxwell:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whether this vast homogeneous expanse of
isotropic matter is fitted not only to be a medium
of physical interaction between distant bodies,
and to fulfil other physical functions of which,
perhaps, we have as yet no conception, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
... to constitute the material organism of beings
exercising functions of life and mind as high or
higher than ours are at present&mdash;is a question far
transcending the limits of physical speculation."</p></blockquote>

<p>And there for the present I leave that aspect of
the subject.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Ether and Matter.</i></p>

<p>I shall now attempt to illustrate some relations
between ether and matter.</p>

<p>The question is often asked, is ether material?
This is largely a question of words and convenience.
Undoubtedly, the ether belongs to the material or
physical universe, but it is not ordinary matter.
I should prefer to say it is not "matter" at all.
It may be the substance or substratum or material
of which matter is composed, but it would be
confusing and inconvenient not to be able to
discriminate between matter on the one hand,
and ether on the other. If you tie a knot on a bit
of string, the knot is composed of string, but the
string is not composed of knots. If you have a
smoke or vortex-ring in the air, the vortex-ring is
made of air, but the atmosphere is not a vortex-ring;
and it would be only confusing to say that
it was.</p>

<p>The essential distinction between matter and
ether is that matter <i>moves</i>, in the sense that it has
the property of locomotion and can effect impact
and bombardment; while ether is <i>strained</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
has the property of exerting stress and recoil.
All potential energy exists in the ether. It may
vibrate, and it may rotate, but as regards locomotion
it is stationary&mdash;the most stationary body
we know: absolutely stationary, so to speak;
our standard of rest.</p>

<p>All that we ourselves can effect, in the material
universe, is to alter the motion and configuration
of masses of matter; we can move matter, by our
muscles, and that is all we can do directly: everything
else is indirect.</p>

<p>But now comes the question, how is it possible
for matter to be composed of ether? How is it
possible for a solid to be made out of fluid? A
solid possesses the properties of rigidity, impenetrability,
elasticity, and such-like; how can these
be imitated by a perfect fluid such as the ether
must be?</p>

<p>The answer is, they can be imitated by a <i>fluid
in motion</i>; a statement which we make with
confidence as the result of a great part of Lord
Kelvin's work.</p>

<p>It may be illustrated by a few experiments.</p>

<p>A wheel of spokes, transparent or permeable
when stationary, becomes opaque when revolving,
so that a ball thrown against it does not go through,
but rebounds. The motion only affects permeability
to matter; transparency to light is unaffected.</p>

<p>A silk cord hanging from a pulley becomes rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and viscous when put into rapid motion; and
pulses or waves which may be generated on the
cord travel along it with a speed equal to its own
velocity, whatever that velocity may be, so that
they appear to stand still. This is a genuine case
of kinetic rigidity; and the fact that the wave-transmission
velocity is equal to the rotatory
speed of the material, is typical and important,&mdash;for
in all cases of kinetic elasticity these two
velocities are of the same order of magnitude.</p>

<p>A flexible chain, set spinning, can stand up on
end while the motion continues.</p>

<p>A jet of water at sufficient speed can be struck
with a hammer, and resists being cut with a sword.</p>

<p>A spinning disk of paper becomes elastic like
flexible metal, and can act like a circular saw.
Sir William White tells me that in naval construction
steel plates are cut by a rapidly revolving
disk of soft iron.</p>

<p>A vortex-ring, ejected from an elliptical orifice,
oscillates about the stable circular form, as an
india-rubber ring would do; thus furnishing a
beautiful example of kinetic elasticity, and showing
us clearly a fluid displaying some of the properties
of a solid.</p>

<p>A still further example is Lord Kelvin's model
of a spring balance, made of nothing but rigid
bodies in spinning motion.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
This arrangement utilises the processional movement of balanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gyrostats&mdash;concealed in a case and supporting a
book&mdash;to imitate the behaviour of a spiral spring,
if it were used to support the same book.</p>

<p>If the ether can be set spinning, therefore, we
may have some hope of making it imitate the
properties of matter, or even of constructing
matter by its aid. But <i>how</i> are we to spin the
ether? Matter alone seems to have no grip of it.
As already described, I have spun steel disks, a
yard in diameter, 4000 times a minute, have sent
light round and round between them, and tested
carefully for the slightest effect on the ether. Not
the slightest effect was perceptible. We cannot
spin ether mechanically.</p>

<p>But we can vibrate it electrically; and every
source of radiation does that. An electrical charge,
in sufficiently rapid vibration, is the only source
of ether-waves that we know; and if an electric
charge is suddenly stopped, it generates the pulses
known as X-rays, as the result of the collision.
Not speed, but sudden change of speed, is the
necessary condition for generating waves in the
ether by electricity.</p>

<p>We can also infer some kind of rotary motion in
the ether; though we have no such obvious means
of detecting the spin as is furnished by vision for
detecting some kinds of vibration. Rotation is supposed
to exist whenever we put a charge into the
neighbourhood of a magnetic pole. Round the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
joining the two, the ether is spinning like a top.
I do not say it is spinning fast: that is a question
of its density; it is in fact spinning with excessive
slowness, but it is spinning with a definite moment
of momentum. J.J. Thomson's theory makes its
moment of momentum exactly equal to <i>e m</i>, the
product of <i>charge</i> and <i>pole</i>; the charge being
measured electrostatically and the pole magnetically.</p>

<p>How can this be shown experimentally? Suppose
we had a spinning top enclosed in a case, so
that the spin was unrecognisable by ordinary
means&mdash;it could be detected by its gyrostatic
behaviour to force. If allowed to "precess" it
will respond by moving perpendicularly to a
deflecting force. So it is with the charge and the
magnetic pole. Try to move the charge suddenly,
and it immediately sets off at right angles. A
moving charge is a current, and the pole and the
current try to revolve round one another;&mdash;a
fact which may be regarded as exhibiting a true
gyrostatic action due to the otherwise unrecognisable
etherial spin. The fact of such magnetic
rotation was discovered by Faraday.</p>

<p>I know that it is usually worked out in another
way, in terms of lines of force and the rest of the
circuit; but I am thinking of a current as a stream
of projected charges; and no one way of regarding
such a matter is likely to exhaust the truth, or
to exclude other modes which are equally valid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Anyhow, in whatever way it is regarded, it is an
example of the three rectangular vectors.</p>

<p>The three vectors at right angles to each other,
which may be labelled Current, Magnetism, and
Motion respectively, or more generally E, H, and
V, represent the quite fundamental relation between
ether and matter, and constitute the link
between Electricity, Magnetism, and Mechanics.
Where any two of these are present, the third is
a necessary consequence. This principle is the
basis of all dynamos, of electric motors, of light,
of telegraphy, and of most other things. Indeed,
it is a question whether it does not underlie everything
that we know in the whole of the physical
sciences; and whether it is not the basis of our
conception of the three dimensions of space.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the fundamental property of
matter called <i>inertia</i>, which can, to a certain
extent, be explained electromagnetically, provided
the ethereous density is granted as of the
order 10<sup>12</sup> grammes per cubic centimetre. The
elasticity of the ether would then have to be of
the order 10<sup>33</sup> c.g.s.; and if this is due to intrinsic
turbulence, the speed of the whirling or rotational
elasticity must be of the same order as the velocity
of light. This follows hydrodynamically; in the
same sort of way as the speed at which a pulse
travels on a flexible running endless cord, whose
tension is entirely due to the centrifugal force of
the motion, is precisely equal to the velocity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the cord itself. And so, on our present view, the
intrinsic energy of constitution of the ether is
incredibly and portentously great; every cubic
millimetre of space possessing what, if it were
matter, would be a mass of a thousand tons, and
an energy equivalent to the output of a million-horse-power
station for 40 million years.</p>

<p>The universe we are living in is an extraordinary
one; and our investigation of it has only
just begun. We know that matter has a psychical
significance, since it can constitute <i>brain</i>, which
links together the physical and the psychical
worlds. If any one thinks that the ether, with all
its massiveness and energy, has probably no
psychical significance, I find myself unable to
agree with him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>STRENGTH OF THE ETHER</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> show that the ether cannot be the slight
and rarefied substance which at one time,
and indeed until quite lately, it was thought to be,
it is useful to remember that not only has it to be
the vehicle of light and the medium of all electric
and magnetic influence, but also that it has to
transmit the tremendous forces of gravitation.</p>

<p>Among small bodies gravitational forces are
slight, and are altogether exceeded by magnetic
and electric or chemical forces. Indeed gravitational
attraction between bodies of a certain
smallness can be more than counterbalanced even
by the pressure which their mutual radiation
exerts&mdash;almost infinitesimal though that is;&mdash;so
that as a matter of fact, small enough bodies of
any warmth will repel each other unless they are
in an enclosure of constant temperature, i.e.
unless the radiation pressure upon them is uniform
all round.</p>

<p>The size at which radiation repulsion over-balances
gravitational attraction, for equal spheres,
depends on the temperature of the spheres and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
their density; but at the ordinary temperature
to which we are accustomed, say 60° Fahrenheit
or thereabouts, equality between the two forces
will obtain for two wooden spheres in space if
each is about a foot in diameter; according to
Professor Poynting's data (<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
Vol. 202, p. 541). For smaller or hotter
bodies, radiation repulsion overpowers mutual
gravitation; and it increases with the fourth
power of their absolute temperature. The gravitational
attractive force between particles is exceedingly
small; and that between two atoms or two
electrons is negligibly small, even though they be
within molecular distance of each other.</p>

<p>For instance, two atoms of, say, gold, at molecular
distance, attract each other gravitationally
with a force of the order</p>

<p class="cen">&#947;<a class="num">(10 <sup>-22</sup> x 10<sup>-22</sup>)</a> / <a class="denom">(10<sup>-8</sup>)²</a> = <span class="num">10<sup>-44</sup></span>/<span class="denom">10<sup>-16</sup></span> x 10<sup>-7</sup> = 10<sup>-35</sup> dyne;</p>

<p class="noin">which would cause no perceptible acceleration
at all.</p>

<p>The gravitational attraction of two electrons at
the same distance is the forty-thousand-millionth
part of this, and so one would think must be
entirely negligible. And yet it is to the aggregate
attraction of myriads of such bodies that the
resultant force of attraction is due;&mdash;a force
which is felt over millions of miles. The force is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
not only felt indeed, but must be reckoned as
one of prodigious magnitude.</p>

<p>When dealing with bodies of astronomical size,
the force of gravitation overpowers all other
forces; and all electric and magnetic attractions
sink by comparison into insignificance.</p>

<p>These immense forces must be transmitted by
the ether, and it is instructive to consider their
amount.</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Arithmetical Calculation of the Pull of the
Earth on the Moon.</i></p>

<p>The mass of the earth is 6000 trillion (6 × 10<sup>21</sup>)
tons. The mass of the moon is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>80</sub>th that of the
earth. Terrestrial gravity at the moon's distance
(which is 60 earth radii) must be reduced in the
ratio 1:60²; that is, it must be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3600</sub>th of what
it is here.</p>

<p>Consequently the pull of the earth on the
moon is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num">6 × 10<sup>21</sup></span> / <span class="denom">80 × 3600</span> tons weight.</p>

<p>A pillar of steel which could transmit this force,
provided it could sustain a tension of 40 tons to
the square inch, would have a diameter of about
400 miles; as stated in the text, page 102.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>If this force were to be transmitted by a forest
of weightless pillars each a square foot in cross-section,
with a tension of 30 tons to the square inch
throughout, there would have to be 5 million
million of them.</p>


<p><i>Arithmetical Calculation of the Pull of the
Sun on the Earth.</i></p>

<p>The mass of the earth is 6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons. The
intensity of solar gravity at the sun's surface is
25 times ordinary terrestrial gravity.</p>

<p>At the earth's distance, which is nearly 200
solar radii, solar gravity will be reduced in the
ratio of 1:200 squared.</p>

<p>Hence the force exerted by the sun on the earth
is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num">25 × 6 × 10<sup>21</sup></span> / <span class="denom">(200)²</span> tons weight.</p>

<p>That is to say, it is approximately equal to the
weight of 37 × 10<sup>17</sup> ordinary tons upon the earth's
surface.</p>

<p>Now steel may readily be found which can
stand a load of 37 tons to every square inch of
cross-section. The cross-section of a bar of such
steel, competent to transmit the sun's pull to the
earth, would therefore have to be</p>

<p class="cen">10<sup>17</sup> square inches,<br />

or say 700 × 10<sup>12</sup> square feet.</p>

<p>And this is equivalent to a million million round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
rods or pillars each 30 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Hence the statement in the text (page 26) is
well within the mark.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>The Pull of the Earth on the Sun.</i></p>

<p>The pull of the earth on the sun is, of course,
equal and opposite to the pull of the sun on the
earth, which has just been calculated; but it
furnishes another mode of arriving at the result,
and may be regarded as involving simpler data&mdash;i.e.
data more generally known. All we need say
is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The mass of the Sun is 316,000 times that of the
Earth.</p>

<p>The mean distance of the sun is, say, 23,000
earth radii.</p>

<p>Hence the weight or pull of the sun by the
earth is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num">316000</span> / <span class="denom">(23000)²</span> × 6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons weight.</p>

<p>In other words, it is approximately equal to the
ordinary commercial weight of 36 × 10<sup>17</sup> tons, as
already calculated.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>The Centripetal Force acting on the Earth.</i></p>

<p>Yet another method of calculating the sun's
pull is to express it in terms of the centrifugal
force of the earth; namely, its mass, multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
by the square of its angular velocity, multiplied
by the radius of its orbit;&mdash;that is to say,</p>

<p class="cen">F = M (<span class="num">2&#960;</span> / <span class="denom">T</span>)² <i>r</i></p>

<p class="noin">where T is the length of a year.</p>

<p>The process of evaluating this is instructive,
owing to the manipulation of units which it
involves:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cen">F = 6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons × <span class="num">(4&#960;² × 92 × 10<sup>6</sup> miles)</span> / <span class="denom">(365 &frac14; days)²</span></p>

<p class="noin">which of course is a mass multiplied by an acceleration.
The acceleration is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="num">(40 × 92 × 10<sup>6</sup>)</span> / <span class="denom">133300 × (24)²</span> miles per hour per hour</p>

<p>= <span class="num">(3680 × 10<sup>6</sup> × 5280)</span> / <span class="denom">133300 × 576 × (3600)²</span> feet per sec. per sec.</p>

<p>= <span class="num">(115 × 5280)</span> / <span class="denom">133300 × 576 × 12·96</span> × 32 feet per sec. per sec.</p>

<p>= <span class="num"><i>g</i></span> / <span class="denom">1640</span></p>

<p>Hence the Force of attraction is that which,
applied to the earth's mass, produces in it an
acceleration equal to the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1640</sub>th part of what
ordinary terrestrial gravity can produce in falling
bodies; or</p>

<p class="cen">F = 6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons × <span class="num"><i>g</i></span> / <span class="denom">1640</span></p>

<p class="cen">= <span class="num">6</span> / <span class="denom">1640</span> × 10<sup>21</sup> tons weight; </p>

<p class="noin">which is the ordinary weight of 37 × 10<sup>17</sup> tons, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
before.</p>

<p>The slight numerical discrepancy between the
above results is of course due to the approximate
character of the data selected, which are taken
in round numbers as quite sufficient for purposes
of illustration.</p>

<p>If we imagine the force applied to the earth by
a forest of round rods, one for every square foot of
the earth's surface&mdash;i.e. of the projected earth's
hemisphere or area of equatorial plane,&mdash;the force
transmitted by each would have to be 2700 tons;
and therefore, if of 30-ton steel, they would each
have to be eleven inches in diameter, or nearly in
contact, all over the earth.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Pull of a Planet on the Earth.</i></p>

<p>While we are on the subject, it seems interesting
to record the fact that the pull of any planet on
the earth, even Neptune, distant though it is, is
still a gigantic force. The pull of Neptune is
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>20,000</sub>th of the sun's pull: i.e. it is 18 billion tons
weight.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Pull of a Star on the Earth.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, the pull of a fixed star, like
Sirius&mdash;say a star, for example, which is 20 times
the mass of the sun and 24 light years distant&mdash;is
comparatively very small.</p>

<p>It is easily found by dividing 20 times the sun's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pull by the squared ratio of 24 years to 8 minutes;
and it comes out as 30 million tons weight.</p>

<p>Such a force is able to produce no perceptible
effect. The acceleration it causes in the earth and
the whole solar system, at its present speed
through space, is only able to curve the path with
a radius of curvature of length thirty thousand
times the distance of the star.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Force required to hold together the Components<br />
of some Double Stars.</i></p>

<p>But it is not to be supposed that the transmission
of any of these forces gives the ether the
slightest trouble, or strains it to anywhere near
the limits of its capacity. Such forces must be
transmitted with perfect ease, for there are plenty
of cases where the force of gravitation is vastly
greater than that. In the case of double stars, for
instance, two suns are whirling round each other;
and some of them are whirling remarkably fast.
In such cases the force holding the components
together must be enormous.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking case, for which we
have substantially accurate data, is the star
&#946; Aurigæ; which, during the general spectroscopic
survey of the heavens undertaken by
Professor Pickering of Harvard, in connexion
with the Draper Memorial, was discovered to show
a spectrum with the lines some days double and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
alternate days single. Clearly it must consist of
a pair of luminous objects revolving in a plane
approximately containing the line of vision; the
revolution being completed every four days.
For the lines will then be optically displaced by
the motion, during part of the orbit&mdash;those of the
advancing body to the right, those of the receding
body to the left,&mdash;while in that part of the orbit
which lies athwart the direction of vision, the
spectrum lines will return to their proper places,&mdash;opening
out again to a maximum, in the opposite
direction, at the next quadrant.</p>

<p>The amount of displacement can be roughly
estimated, enabling us to calculate the speed
with which the sources of light were moving.</p>

<p>Professor Pickering, in a brief statement in
<i>Nature</i>, Vol. XLI, page 403, 1889, says that the
velocity amounts to about 150 miles per second,
and that it is roughly the same for both components.</p>

<p>Taking these data:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin" style="margin-left:5em;">Equality and uniformity of speeds,<br />
150 miles per second each,<br />
Period 4 days,</p>

<p class="noin">we have all the data necessary to determine the
masses; and likewise the gravitative pull between
them. For the star must consist of two equal
bodies, revolving about a common centre of
gravity midway between them, in nearly circular
orbits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The speed and period together easily give the
radius of the circular orbit as about 8 million
miles.</p>

<p>Equating centrifugal and centripetal forces</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num"><i>mv</i>²</span> / <span class="denom"><i>r</i></span> = &#947; <span class="num"><i>m</i>²</span> / <span class="denom">(2<i>r</i>)²</span></p>

<p class="noin">and comparing the value of 4r³ / T² so obtained
with the r³ / T² of the earth, we find the mass of
each body must be about 30,000 times that of the
earth, or about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th that of the sun.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>(This is treating them as spheres, though they
must really be pulled into decidedly prolate
shapes. Indeed it may seem surprising that the
further portions can keep up with the nearer
portions as they revolve. If they are of something
like solar density their diameter will be comparable
to half a million miles, and the natural
periods of their near and far portions will differ
in the ratio (<sup>17</sup>/<sub>16</sub>)<sup>3/2</sup> = 1·1 approximately. Tenacity
could not hold the parts together, but gravitational
coherence would.)</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This, however, is a digression. Let us continue
the calculation of the gravitative pull.</p>

<p>We have masses of 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> × 6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons, revolving
with angular velocity 2&#960; ÷ 4 days, in a
circle of radius 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently the centripetal acceleration is
<span class="num">4 &#960;² × 8 × 10<sup>6</sup></span> / <span class="denom">16</span> miles per day per day; which
comes out <sup>32</sup> / <sub>2·2</sub> ft. per sec. per sec., or nearly half
ordinary terrestrial gravity.</p>

<p>Consequently the pull between the two components
of the double star &#946; Aurigæ is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num"><i>g</i></span> / <span class="denom">2.2</span> × 18 × 10<sup>25</sup> tons,</p>

<p class="noin">or equal to the weight of</p>

<p class="cen">80 × 10<sup>24</sup> tons on the earth,</p>

<p class="noin">which is more than twenty million times as great
as is the pull between the earth and our sun.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Simple calculations such as these could have
been made at any time; there is nothing novel
about them, as there is about the estimate of the
ether's density and vast intrinsic energy, in
Chapters <a href="#Page_80">VI</a> and <a href="#Page_87">VII</a>. But then there is nothing
hypothetical or uncertain about them either; they
are certain and definite: whereas it may be
thought there is something doubtful about the
newer contentions which involve consideration
of the mass and size of electrons and of the uniform
and incompressible character of etherial
constitution. Even the idea of "massiveness"
as applied to the ether involves an element of uncertainty,
or of figurativeness; because until we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
know more about ether's peculiar nature (if it is
peculiar), we have to deal with it in accordance
with material analogies, and must specify its
massiveness as that which would have to be
possessed by it if it fulfilled its functions and yet
were anything like ordinary matter. It cannot
really <i>be</i> ordinary matter, because ordinary
matter is definitely differentiated from it, and
is presumably composed of it; but the inertia
of ordinary matter, however it be electrically
or magnetically explained, must in the last
resort depend on something parentally akin to
inertia in the fundamental substance which fills
space. And this it is which we have attempted
in Chapters <a href="#Page_80">VI</a> and <a href="#Page_87">VII</a> to evaluate and to express
in the soberest terms possible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>GENERAL THEORY OF ABERRATION</h3>


<p>In Chapter <a href="#Page_29">III</a> the subject of Aberration was
treated in a simple and geometrical manner,
but it is now time to deal with it more generally.
And to do this compactly I must be content in
the greater part of this chapter to appeal chiefly
to physicists.</p>

<p>The following general statements concerning
aberration can be made:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A ray of light in clear space is straight, whatever
the motion of the medium, unless eddies
exist; in other words, no irrotational disturbance
of ether can deflect a ray.</p>

<p>2. But if the observer is in motion, the apparent
ray will not be the true ray, and his line of
vision will not truly indicate the direction of an
object.</p>

<p>3. In a stationary ether the ray coincides with
wave-normal. In a moving ether the ray and wave-normal
enclose an aberration angle &#949;, such that
sin &#949;=<i>v</i>/V, the ratio of the ether speed to the light
speed.</p>

<p>4. In all cases the line of vision depends on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
motion of the observer, and on that alone. If the
observer is stationary, his line of vision is a ray.
If he moves at the same rate as the ether, his line
of vision is a wave-normal.</p>

<p>5. Line of vision depends not at all on the
motion of the ether, so long as it has a velocity-potential.
Hence if this condition is satisfied the
theory of aberration is quite simple.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>General Statement as to Negative Results in the</i><br />
<i>Subject.</i></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that almost all the observations
which have been made with negative results as to
the effect of the Earth's orbital motion on the
ether are equally consistent with complete connexion
and complete independence between ether
and matter. If there is complete connexion, the
ether near the earth is relatively stagnant, and
negative terrestrial results are natural. If there
is complete independence, the ether is either
absolutely stationary or has a velocity-potential,
and the negative results are, as has been shown,
thereby explained. Direct experiment on the
subject of etherial viscosity proves that that is
either really or approximately zero, and substantiates
the "independence" explanation.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Definition of a Ray.</i></p>

<p>A ray signifies the path of a definite or identical
portion of radiation energy&mdash;the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
energy-flux. In other words, it may be considered
as the path of a labelled disturbance; for it
is some special feature which enables an eye to fix
direction: it is that which determines the line of
collimation of a telescope.</p>

<p>Now in order that a disturbance from A may
reach B, it is necessary that adjacent elements of
a wave front at A shall arrive at B in the same
phase; hence the path by which a disturbance
travels must satisfy this condition from point to
point. This condition will be satisfied if the time
of journey down a ray and down all infinitesimally
differing paths is the same.</p>

<p>The equation to a ray is therefore contained in
the statement that the time taken by light to
traverse it is a minimum; or</p>

<p class="cen">
<span class="intbig">&#8747;<sub class="intbot">A</sub><sup class="inttop">B</sup></span>
<span class="num"><i>ds</i></span> / <span class="denom">V</span> = minimum</p>

<p>If the medium, instead of being stationary, is
drifting with the velocity <i>v</i>, at angle &#952; to the ray,
we must substitute for V the modified velocity
V cos &#949; + <i>v</i> cos &#952;; and so the function that has
to be a minimum, in order to give the path of a
ray in a moving medium, is</p>

<p class="cen">
Time of journey =
<span class="intbig">&#8747;<sub class="intbot">A</sub><sup class="inttop">B</sup></span>
<span class="num"><i>ds</i></span> / <span class="denom">V(cos &#949; + &#945; cos &#952;)</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p class="cen">=
<span class="intbig">&#8747;<sub class="intbot">A</sub><sup class="inttop">B</sup></span>
<span class="num">(V cos &#949; &#8722; <i>v</i> cos &#952;)</span> /
<span class="denom">V²(1 &#8722; &#945;²)</span>  <i>ds</i> = minimum</p>

<p class="noin">where &#945; is the ratio <i>v</i>/V.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Path of Ray, and Time of Journey, through an<br />
Irrotationally Moving Medium.</i></p>

<p>Writing a velocity-potential &#966; in the above
equation to a ray, that is putting</p>

<p class="cen"><i>v</i> cos &#952; = <span class="num">&#948;&#966;</span> / <span class="denom">&#948;<i>s</i></span>,</p>

<p class="noin">and ignoring possible variations in the minute
correction factor 1&#8722;&#945;² between the points A
and B, it becomes</p>

<p class="cen">Time of journey =
<span class="intbig">&#8747;<sub class="intbot">A</sub><sup class="inttop">B</sup></span>
<span class="num">cos &#949;</span> / <span class="denom">(1 &#8722; &#945;²)</span> ·
<span class="num"><i>ds</i></span> / <span class="denom">V</span>&nbsp; &#8722;&nbsp;
<span class="num">(&#966;B  &#8722; &#966;A)</span> / <span class="denom">V²( 1&#8722;&#945;²)</span> = minimum.</p>

<p>Now the second term depends only on end
points, and therefore has no effect on path. The
first term contains only the second power of
aberration magnitude; and hence it has much
the same value as if everything were stationary.
A ray that was straight, will remain straight in
spite of motion. Whatever shape it had, that it
will retain.</p>

<p>Only cos &#949;, and variations in &#945;², can produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
any effect on path; and effects so produced must
be very small, since the value of cos &#949; is</p>

<p class="cen">&#8730;(1&#8722;&#945;²sin²&#952;).</p>

<p>A second-order effect on direction may therefore
be produced by irrotational motion, but not
a first-order effect. A similar statement applies
to the time of journey round any closed periphery.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Michelson's Experiment.</i></p>

<p>We conclude, therefore, that general etherial
drift does not affect either the path of a ray, or the
time of its journey to and fro, or round a complete
contour, to any important extent. But that
taking second-order quantities into account, the
time of going to and fro in any direction inclined
at angle &#952; to a constant drift is, from the above
expression,</p>

<p class="cen">T<sub>1</sub> + T<sub>2</sub> =
<span class="num">2T cos &#949;</span> / <span class="denom">1&#8722;&#945;²</span> =
<span class="num">&#8730;(1&#8722;&#945;²sin²&#952;)</span> /
<span class="denom">(1 &#8722; &#945;²)</span> × 2T,</p>

<p class="noin">where 2T is the ordinary time of the double
journey without any drift.</p>

<p>Hence some slight modification of interference
effects by reason of drift would seem to be possible;
since the time of a to-and-fro light-journey depends
subordinately on the inclination of ray to
drift.</p>

<p>The above expression applies to Michelson's
remarkable experiment<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of sending a split beam
to and fro, half along and half across the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the earth's motion; and is, in fact, a theory of it.
There ought to be an effect due to the difference
between &#952; = 0 and &#952; = 90°. But none can be
detected. Hence, either something else happens,
or the ether near the earth is dragged with it so
as not to stream through our instruments.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Alternative Explanation.</i></p>

<p>But if the ether is dragged along near moving
matter, it behaves like a viscous fluid, and all
idea of a velocity-potential must be abandoned.
This would complicate the theory of aberration
(pp. <a href="#Page_45">45</a> and <a href="#Page_61">61</a>), and moreover is dead against the
experimental evidence described in Chapter <a href="#Page_67">V</a>.</p>

<p>The negative result of Mr. Michelson's is, however,
explicable in another way,&mdash;namely, by the
FitzGerald-Lorentz theory that the linear dimensions
of bodies are a function of their motion
through the ether. And such an effect it is
reasonable to expect; since, if cohesion forces are
electrical, they must be affected by motion, to a
known and calculable amount, depending on the
square of the ratio of the speed to the velocity of
light. (See end of Chap. <a href="#Page_44">IV</a>.)</p>

<p>The theory of Professor H.A. Lorentz, accordingly,
shows that the shape of Michelson's stone
supporting block will be distorted by the motion;
its dimensions across and along the line of ether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
drift being affected differently. And the amount of
the change will be such as precisely to compensate
and neutralise the optical effect of motion which
might otherwise be perceived. This theory is
now generally accepted.</p>

<p>It is this neutralising or compensatory effect,&mdash;which
acts equally on to-and-fro motion of light,
to-and-fro motion of electric currents, and on
the shape of material bodies,&mdash;that renders any
positive result in experiments on ether-drift so
difficult or impossible to obtain; so that, in spite
of the speed with which we are rushing through
space, no perceptible influence is felt on either
electrical or optical phenomena, except those
which are due to relative motion of source and
observer.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Some Details in the Theory of the Doppler Effect,<br />
or Effect of Motion on Dispersion<br />
by Prism or Grating.</i></p>

<p>When light is analysed by a prism or grating
into a spectrum, the course of each ray is deflected&mdash;refracted
or diffracted&mdash;by an amount
corresponding to its frequency of vibration or
wave-length.</p>

<p>Motion of the medium, so long as it is steady,
affects neither frequency nor wave-length, and
accordingly is without influence on the result.
It produces no Doppler effect except when waxing
or waning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Motion of the source alone crowds the waves
together on the advancing side and spreads them
out on the receding side. An observer therefore
whom the source is approaching receives shorter
waves, and one from whom the source is receding
receives longer waves, than normal. At any fixed
point waves will arrive, therefore, with modified
frequency.</p>

<p>So long as a source is stationary the wave-lengths
emitted are quite normal, but motion of
an observer may change the frequency with
which they are <i>received</i>, in an obvious way; they
are swept up faster if the receiver is approaching,
they have a stern chase if it is receding.</p>

<p>All this is familiar, and was geometrically
illustrated in Chapter <a href="#Page_29">III</a>, but there are some
minor and rather curious details which are worthy
of brief consideration.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Grating Theory.</i></p>

<p>For suppose a 'grating' is used to analyse the
light. Its effect can depend on nothing kinetic;
it must be regulated by the merely geometric
width of the ruled spaces on it. Consequently it
can only directly apprehend wave-lengths, not
frequencies.</p>

<p>In the case of a moving <i>source</i>, therefore, when
the wave-length is really changed, a grating will
appreciate the fact, and will show a true Doppler
effect. But in the case of a moving <i>observer</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
when all the waves received are of normal length,
though swept up with abnormal frequency, the
grating must still indicate wave-length alone, and
accordingly will show no true Doppler effect.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as the telescope or line of vision
is inclined at the angle of dispersion to the direction
of the incident ray, ordinary aberration must
come in, as it always does when an observer moves
athwart his line of vision; and so there will be a
spurious or apparent Doppler effect due to common
aberration. That is to say a spectrum line will not
be seen in its true place, but will appear to be
shifted by an amount almost exactly imitative of
a real Doppler effect&mdash;the imitation being correct
up to the second order of aberration magnitude.
The slight outstanding difference between them
is calculated in my <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
paper, 1893, page 787. It is too small to observe.</p>

<p>It is not an important matter, but as it is
rather troublesome to work out the diffraction
observed by a grating advancing towards the
source of light, it may be as well to record the
result here.</p>

<p>The following are the diffracted rays which
require attention,&mdash;with the inclination of each to
the grating-normal specified:&mdash;</p>

<p>The diffracted ray if all were stationary, &#952;<sub>0</sub>;</p>

<p>The real diffracted ray when grating is
advancing, &#966;;</p>

<p>The ray as perceived, allowing for aberration, &#952;;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The equivalent diffracted ray if all were
stationary and the wave-length really
shortened,               &#952;<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>As an auxiliary we use the aberration angle &#949;,
such that sin &#949; = &#945; sin &#952;, where &#945; = <i>v</i>/V.</p>

<p>Among these four angles the following relations
hold; so that, given one of them, all are known.</p>

<table summary="">

<p>Whence &#952; and &#952;<sub>1</sub> are very nearly but not absolutely
the same. &#952;<sub>1</sub> is the ray observed by an instrument
depending primarily on frequency, like a prism;
&#952; is the ray observed by an instrument depending
primarily on wave-length, like a grating.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Prism Theory.</i></p>

<p>Now let a prism be used to analyse the light; its
dispersive power is in most theories held to depend
directly upon frequency&mdash;i.e. upon a time relation
between the period of a light vibration and the
period of an atomic or electronic revolution or
other harmonic excursion.</p>

<p>Let us say, therefore, that prismatic dispersion
directly indicates frequency. It cannot depend
upon wave-length, for the wave-length inside
different substances is different, and though
refractive index corresponds to this, dispersive
power does not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of a prism, therefore, no distinction
can be drawn between motion of source and
motion of receiver; for in both cases the frequency
with which the waves are received will
be altered,&mdash;either because they are really shorter,
though arriving at normal speed, or because they
are swept up faster, although of normal length.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Achromatic Prism.</i></p>

<p>It must be noticed that the observation of
Doppler effect by a prism depends entirely on
dispersion; i.e. on waves of different length
being affected differently. But prisms can be
constructed whose dispersion is corrected and
neutralised. Such achromatic prisms, if perfectly
achromatic, will treat waves of all sizes
alike; and, accordingly, the shortening of the
waves from a moving source will not produce
any effect. Achromatic prisms will therefore
behave to terrestrial and to extra-terrestrial
sources, i.e. to relatively stationary and relatively
moving sources, in the same way.</p>

<p>This must be recollected in connexion with
several of the negative results rightly obtained
by some observers; such as Arago, for instance,
who applied an achromatic prism to a star which
the earth was approaching, without observing any
effect. A Doppler effect should have been observed
by a dispersive prism, but not by an achro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>matic
one: for the refractive index of a substance
is not affected by any motion of the earth.</p>

<p>It is not reasonable to expect that refractive
index would be affected, since it depends in simple
geometrical fashion on retarded velocity, i.e. on
optical etherial loading or apparent extra internal
density.</p>

<p>An achromatic <i>grating</i>, however, is (rashly
speaking) an impossibility.</p>


<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Effect of Transparent Matter.</span></p>

<p>But when a ray is travelling through transparent
matter, will not motion of that matter
affect its course?</p>

<p>If the matter is moved relatively to source and
receiver, as in Fizeau's experiment with running
water, most certainly it will; to the full effect of
the loading or extra or travelling density, (&#956;²-1),
compared with the total density &#956;².</p>

<p>This fraction of the velocity of the material
medium must directly influence the velocity of
light, for the waves will be conveyed in the sense
of the material motion <i>u</i>, with the additional speed
<i>u</i>(&#956;²-1) / &#956;². (See also Appendix <a href="#APPENDIX_3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>But if the transparent matter through which
the light is going is stationary with respect to
source and receiver&mdash;only sharing with them the
general planetary motion, i.e. being subject to the
opposite all-pervading ether drift,&mdash;then no in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>fluence
due to the drift can be experienced; for
the free ether of space behaves just as it would if
the matter were not there. This can be shown
more elaborately by the following calculation.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Optical Effect of Ether Drift through Dense<br />
Stationary Bodies.</i></p>

<p>The calculation of the lag in phase caused by
Fresnel's etherial motion may proceed thus:&mdash;A
dense slab of thickness <i>z</i>, which would naturally
be traversed with the velocity V/&#956;, is traversed
with the velocity (V/&#956;) cos &#949; + (<i>v</i>/&#956;²) cos &#952;; where
<i>v</i> is the relative velocity of the ether in its neighbourhood;
whence the time of journey through
it is</p>

<p class="cen">
<span class="num">&#956;<i>z</i></span> / <span class="denom">V(cos &#949; + <sup>&#945;</sup>/<sub>&#956;</sub> cos &#952;)</span>,&nbsp; instead of
<span class="num">&#956;<i>z</i></span> / <span class="denom">V</span>,</p>

<p class="noin">So the equivalent air thickness, instead of being
(&#956; &#8722; 1)<i>z</i>, is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num">&#956;<i>z</i></span> / <span class="denom">cos &#949; + <sup>&#945;</sup>/<sub>&#956;</sub> cos &#952;</span>
&#8722; <i>z</i> = (<span class="num">&#956; cos &#949; &#8722; &#945; cos &#952;</span> /
<span class="denom">(1 &#8722; <sup>&#945;</sup>/<sub>&#956;</sub>)²</span> &#8722; 1)<i>z</i>,</p>

<p class="noin">or, to the first order of minutiæ,</p>

<p class="cen">(&#956; &#8722; 1)<i>z</i> &#8722; &#945;<i>z</i> cos &#952;;</p>

<p class="noin">&#952; being the angle between ray and ether drift
inside the medium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>So the extra equivalent air layer <i>due to the motion</i>
is approximately &plusmn;&#945; z cos &#952;, a quantity independent
of &#956;.</p>

<p>Hence, no plan for detecting this first-order
effect of motion is in any way assisted by the use
of dense stationary substances; their extra ether,
being stationary, does not affect the lag caused
by motion, except indeed in the second order of
small quantities, as shown above.</p>

<p>Direct experiments made by Hoek,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and by
Mascart, on the effect of introducing tubes of
water into the path of half-beams of light, are in
entire accord with this negative conclusion.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we find that no general motion of
the entire medium can be detected by changes in
direction, or in frequency, or in phase; for on
none of them has it any appreciable (i.e. first-order)
effect, even when assisted by dense matter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another mode of stating the matter is to say
that the behaviour of ether inside matter is such
as to enable a potential-function,</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="intbig">&#8747;</span> &#956;²<i>v</i> cos &#952;<i>ds</i>,</p>

<p class="noin">to exist throughout all transparent space, so far
as motion of ether alone is concerned. (See Appendix
<a href="#APPENDIX_3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>The existence of this potential function readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
accounts for the absence of all effect on direction
due to the general drift of the medium, whether
in the presence of dense matter (such as water-filled
telescopes) or otherwise. Whatever may
be the path of a ray by reason of reflexion or
refraction in a stationary ether, it is precisely the
same in a moving one if this condition is satisfied,
although the wave-normals and wave-fronts are
definitely shifted.</p>

<p>However matter affects or loads the ether inside
it, it cannot on this theory be said either to hold it
still, or to carry it with it. The general ether
stream must remain unaffected, not only near,
but inside matter, if rays are to retain precisely
the same course as if it were relatively stationary.</p>

<p>But it must be understood that the etherial
motion here contemplated is the <i>general drift of
the entire medium</i>; or its correlative, the uniform
motion of all the matter concerned. There is
nothing to be said against aberration effects being
producible or modifiable by motion of <i>parts</i> of the
medium, or by the artificial motion of transparent
bodies and other partitioned-off regions.
<i>Artificial</i> motion of matter may readily alter
both the time of journey and the path of a ray,
for it has no potential conditions to satisfy;
it may easily describe a closed contour, and may
take part in conveying light.</p>

<p>But I must repeat that this conveyance of
light by moving matter is an effect due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
material load only; it represents no disturbance
of the ether of space. Fresnel's law, in fact,
definitely means that moving transparent matter
does <i>not</i> appreciably disturb the ether of space.
Direct experiment, as recorded in Chapter <a href="#Page_67">V</a>,
shows that close to rapidly-moving opaque matter
there is no disturbance either.</p>

<p>I regard the non-disturbance of the ether of
space by moving matter as established.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY.</h2>


<p>The estimates of this book, and of <i>Modern
Views of Electricity</i>, are that the ether of space
is a continuous, incompressible, stationary, fundamental
substance or perfect fluid, with what
is equivalent to an inertia-coefficient of 10<sup>12</sup>
grammes per c.c.; that <i>matter</i> is composed of
modified and electrified specks, or minute structures
of ether, which are amenable to mechanical
as well as to electrical force and add to the
optical or electric density of the medium; and
that elastic-rigidity and all potential energy are
due to excessively fine-grained etherial circulation,
with an intrinsic kinetic energy of the order
10<sup>33</sup> ergs per cubic centimetre.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_1" id="APPENDIX_1"></a>APPENDIX 1</h2>

<h3>ON GRAVITY AND ETHERIAL TENSION</h3>


<p>In the arithmetical examples of Chapter <a href="#Page_115">IX</a> we
reckon merely the force between two bodies;
but the Newtonian tension mentioned in Chapter
<a href="#Page_98">VIII</a> does not signify that force, but rather a certain
condition or state of the medium, to variations
in which, from place to place, the force is due.
This Newtonian tension is a much greater quantity
than the force to which it gives rise; and, moreover,
it exists at every point of space, instead of being
integrated all through an attracted body.</p>

<p>It rises to a maximum value near the surface of
any spherical mass; and if the radius be R and the
gravitational intensity is <i>g</i>, the tension at the surface
is T<sub>0</sub> = <i>g</i>R. At any distance <i>r</i>, further away, the
tension is T = <i>g</i>R²/<i>r</i>.</p>

<p>This follows at once thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Stating the law of gravitation as F = &#947;<span class="num"><i>mm´</i></span> / <span class="denom"><i>r</i>²</span>, the
meaning here adopted for etherial tension at the
surface of the earth is</p>

<p class="cen">T =
<span class="num"><span class="intbig">&#8747;<sub class="intbot">R</sub><sup class="inttop">&#8734;</sup></span> &#947;E</span> /
<span class="denom"><i>r</i>²</span> <i>dr</i> =
<span class="num">&#947;E</span> / <span class="denom">R</span>;</p>

<p class="noin">so that the ordinary intensity of gravity is</p>

<p class="cen"><i>g</i> =
&#8722;<span class="num">dT</span> / <span class="denom">dR</span> =
<span class="num">&#947;E</span> / <span class="denom">R²</span> =
<span class="num">4</span> / <span class="denom">3</span>&#960;&#961;&#947;R.</p>

<p>Accordingly, near the surface of a planet the tension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is T<sub>0</sub> = <i>g</i>R, or for different planets is proportional to
&#961;R².</p>

<p>The velocity of free fall from infinity to such a
planet is &#8730;(2T<sub>0</sub>); the velocity of free fall from circumference
to centre, assuming uniform distribution
of density, is &#8730;(T<sub>0</sub>); and from infinity to centre it
is &#8730;(3T<sub>0</sub>).</p>

<p>Expanding all this into words:&mdash;</p>

<p>The etherial tension near the earth's surface,
required to explain gravity by its rate of variation, is
of the order 6 × 10<sup>11</sup> c.g.s. units. The tension near
the sun is 2500 times as great (p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>). With different
spheres in general, it is proportional to the density
and to the superficial area. Hence, near a bullet
one inch in diameter, it is of the order 10<sup>-6</sup>; and
near an atom or an electron about 10<sup>-21</sup> c.g.s.</p>

<p>If ever the tension rose to equal the constitutional
elasticity or intrinsic kinetic energy of the ether,&mdash;which
we have seen is 10<sup>33</sup> dynes per square centimetre
(or ergs per c.c.) or 10<sup>22</sup> tons weight per
square millimetre,&mdash;it seems likely that something
would give way. But no known mass of matter is
able to cause anything like such a tension.</p>

<p>A smaller aggregate of matter would be able to
generate the velocity of light in bodies falling towards
it from a great distance; and it may be doubted
whether any mass so great as to be able to do even
that can exist in one lump.</p>

<p>In order to set up a tension equal to what is here
suspected of being a critical, or presumably disruptive,
stress in the ether [10<sup>33</sup> c.g.s.], a globe of the
density of the earth would have to have a radius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
eight light years. In order to generate a velocity of
free fall under gravity equal to the velocity of light,
a globe of the earth's density would have to be equal
in radius to the distance of the earth from the sun, or
say 26,000 times the earth's radius. If the density
were less, the superficial area would have to be increased
in proportion, so as to keep &#961; R² constant.</p>

<p>The whole visible universe within a parallax of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>
second of arc, estimated by Lord Kelvin as the
equivalent of 10<sup>9</sup> suns, would be quite incompetent
to raise etherial tension to the critical point 10<sup>33</sup> c.g.s.
unless it were concentrated to an absurd degree; but
it could generate the velocity of light with a density
comparable to that of water, if <i>mass</i> were constant.</p>

<p>If the average density of the above visible universe
(which may be taken as 1.6 × 10<sup>-23</sup> grammes per c.c.)
continued without limit, a disruptive tension of the
ether would be reached when the radius was comparable
to 10<sup>13</sup> light years; and the velocity of light
would be generated by it when the radius was 10<sup>7</sup>
light years. But heterogeneity would enable these
values to be reached <i>more</i> easily.</p>

<p><i>Gravitation</i> is thus supposed to be the result of
a mechanical tension inherently, and perhaps instantaneously,
set up throughout space whenever
the etherial structure called an electric charge comes
into existence; the tension being directly proportional
to the square of the charge and inversely
as its linear dimensions. <i>Cohesion</i> is quite different,
and is due to a residual electrical attraction between
groups of neutral molecules across molecular distances:
a variant or modification of chemical affinity.</p>

<h3>CALCULATIONS IN CONNEXION WITH<br />
ETHER DENSITY</h3>


<p>Just as the rigidity of the ether is of a purely electric
character, and is not felt mechanically&mdash;since
mechanically it is perfectly fluid,&mdash;so its density is
likewise of an electromagnetic character, and again is
not felt mechanically, because it cannot be moved by
mechanical means. It is by far the most stationary
body in existence; though it is endowed with high
intrinsic energy of local movement, analogous to
turbulence, conferring on it gyrostatic properties.</p>

<p>Optically, its rigidity and density are both felt,
since optical disturbances are essentially electromotive.
Matter loads the ether optically, in accordance
with the recognised fraction <span class="num">&#956;²&#8722;1</span> / <span class="denom">&#956;²</span>; and this
loading, being part and parcel of the <i>matter</i>, of
course travels with it. It is the only part amenable
to mechanical force.</p>

<p>The mechanical density of matter is a very small
portion of the etherial density; whereas the
optical or electrical density of matter&mdash;being really
that of ether affected by the intrinsic or constitutional
electricity of matter&mdash;is not so small. The relative
optical virtual density of the ether inside matter
is measured by &#956;²; but it may be really a defect
of elasticity, at least in non-magnetic materials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Electrical and optical effects depend upon <i>e</i>.
Mechanical or inertia effects depend upon <i>e</i>². Electric
charges can load the ether optically, quite appreciably;
but as regards mechanical loading, the densest matter
known is trivial and gossamer-like compared with
the unmodified ether in the same space.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Massiveness of the Ether deduced from Electrical<br />
Principles.</i></p>

<p>Each electron, moving like a sphere through a
fluid, has a certain mass associated with it; dependent
on its size, and, at very high speeds, on its
velocity also.</p>

<p>If we treat the electron merely as a sphere moving
through a perfect liquid, its behaviour is exactly as
if its mass were increased by half that of the fluid
displaced and the surrounding fluid were annihilated.</p>

<p>Ether being incompressible, the density of fluid
inside and outside an electron must be the same.
So, dealing with it in this simplest fashion, the resultant
inertia is half as great again as that of the
volume of fluid corresponding to the electron: that
is to say the effective mass is 2&#960;&#961;&#945;³, where &#961; is the
uniform density. If an electron is of some other
shape than a sphere, then the numerical part is
modified, but remains of the same order of magnitude,
so long as there are no sharp edges.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If, however, we consider the moving electron as
generating circular lines of magnetic induction, by
reason of some rotational property of the ether, and
if we attribute all the magnetic inertia to the magnetic
whirl thus caused round its path,&mdash;provisionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
treating this whirl as an actual circulation of fluid
excited by the locomotion,&mdash;then we shall proceed
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Let a spherical electron <i>e</i> of radius <i>a</i> be flying at
moderate speed <i>u</i>, so that the magnetic field at any
point, <i>r</i>&#952;, outside, is</p>

<p class="cen">H = <span class="num"><i>eu</i> sin&#952;</span> / <span class="denom"><i>r²</i></span>,</p>

<p class="noin">and the energy per unit volume everywhere is
&#956;H²/8&#960;.</p>

<p>But a magnetic field has been thought of by many
mathematicians as a circulation of fluid along the
lines of magnetic induction&mdash;which are always closed
curves&mdash;at some unknown velocity <i>w</i>.</p>

<p>So consider the energy per unit volume anywhere:
it can be represented by the equivalent expressions</p>

<p class="cen">&frac12;&#961;w² =
<span class="num">&#956;H²</span> / <span class="denom">8&#960;</span> =
<span class="num">&#956;</span> / <span class="denom">8&#960;</span> ·
<span class="num"><i>e</i>²<i>u</i>² sin²&#952;</span> / <span class="denom"><i>r</i>²</span>;</p>

<p class="noin">wherefore</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num"><i>w</i></span> / <span class="denom"><i>u</i></span> =
&#8730;(<span class="num">&#956;</span> / <span class="denom">4&#960;&#961;</span>) ·
<span class="num"><i>e</i> sin&#952;</span> / <span class="denom"><i>r</i>²</span>.</p>

<p>The velocity of the hypothetical circulation must
be a maximum at the equator of the sphere, where
<i>r</i>=<i>a</i> and &#952;=90; so, calling this <i>w</i><sub>0</sub>,</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="num"><i>w</i><sub>0</sub></span> / <span class="denom"><i>u</i></span> =

<p class="noin">wherefore the major part of the circulation is limited

<p>Comparing this with a mass moving with speed <i>u</i>,</p>

<p>This agrees with the simple hydrodynamic estimate
of effective inertia if <i>w</i><sub>0</sub> = &frac12; &#8730;3·<i>u</i>; that is to say, if
the whirl in contact with the equator of the sphere
is of the same order of magnitude as the velocity of
the sphere.</p>

<p>Now for the real relation between <i>w</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>u</i> we must
make a hypothesis. If the two are considered equal,
the effectively disturbed mass comes out as twice
that of the bulk of the electron. If <i>w</i><sub>0</sub> is smaller than
<i>u</i>, then the mass of the effectively disturbed fluid is
less even than the bulk of an electron; and in that
case the estimate of the fluid-density &#961; must be <i>exaggerated</i>
in order to supply the required energy. It
is difficult to suppose the equatorial circulation <i>w</i><sub>0</sub>
<i>greater</i> than <i>u</i>, since it is generated by it; and it is
most reasonable to treat them both as of the same
order of magnitude. So, taking them as equal,</p>

<p class="cen"><i>e</i> = <i>a</i>² &#8730;(<span class="num">4&#960;&#961;</span> / <span class="denom">&#956;</span>)</p>

<p class="noin">and <i>m</i> = twice the spherical mass.</p>

<p>Hence all the estimates of the effective inertia of
an electron are of the same order of magnitude, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
all comparable with that of a mass of ether equal to
the electron in bulk. But the linear dimension of an
electron is 10<sup>-13</sup> centimetre diameter, and its mass is
of the order 10<sup>-27</sup> gram. Consequently the density
of its material must be of the order 10<sup>12</sup> grams per
cubic centimetre.</p>

<p>This, truly, is enormous, but any reduction in the
estimate of the circulation-speed, below that of an
electron, would only go to increase it. And, since
electrons move sometimes at a speed not far below
that of light, we cannot be accused of under-estimating
the probable velocity of magnetic spin by treating
it as of the same order of magnitude, at the
bounding surface of the electron, as its own speed:
a relation suggested, though not enforced, by gyrostatic
analogies.</p>


<p class="cen"><i>Some Consequences of this Great Density.</i></p>

<p>The amplitude of a wave of light, in a place where
it is most intense, namely near the sun where its
energy amounts to 2 ergs per c.c., comes out only
about 10<sup>-17</sup> of the wave-length. The maximum
tangential stress called out by such strain is of the
order 10<sup>11</sup> atmospheres.</p>

<p>The hypothetical luminous circulation-velocity,
conferring momentum on a wave-front, in accordance
with Poynting's investigation, comes out 10<sup>-22</sup> cm.
per sec. These calculations are given in the concluding
chapter of the new edition of <i>Modern Views
of Electricity</i>.</p>

<p>The supposed magnetic etherial drift, along the
axis of a solenoid or other magnetic field, if it exist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
is comparable to ·003 centim. per sec., or 4 inches an
hour, for a field of intensity 12,000 c.g.s.</p>

<p>But it is not to be supposed that this hypothetical
velocity is slow everywhere. Close to an electron
the speed of magnetic drift is comparable to the
locomotion-velocity of the electron itself, and may
therefore rise to something near the speed of light;
say <span class="num">1</span>/<span class="denom">30</span>th of that speed: but in spite of that, at
a distance of only 1 millimetre away, it is reduced to
practical stagnation, being less than a millimicron
per century.</p>

<p>In any solenoid, the ampere-turns per linear inch
furnish a measure of the speed of the supposed magnetic
circulation along the axis&mdash;no matter what the
material of the core may be&mdash;in millimicrons per sec.</p>

<blockquote><p>[1 micron = 10<sup>-6</sup> metre; 1 millimicron is 10<sup>-9</sup> metre
= 10<sup>-7</sup> centimetre, or a millionth of a millimetre.]</p></blockquote>

<p>To get up an etherial speed of 1 centimetre per
second&mdash;such as might be detected experimentally
by refined optical appliances, through its effect in
accelerating or retarding the speed of light sent along
the lines of magnetic force,&mdash;would need a solenoid
of great length, round every centimetre of which 1000
amperes circulated 3000 times. That is to say, a
long field of four million c.g.s. units of intensity.</p>

<p>In other words, any streaming along magnetic
lines of force, such as could account for the energy
of a magnetic field, must be comparable, in centimetres
per second, to one four-millionth of the
number of c.g.s. units of intensity in the magnetic
field.</p>

<h3>FRESNEL'S LAW A SPECIAL CASE OF A<br />
UNIVERSAL POTENTIAL FUNCTION</h3>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> modern view of Fresnel's Law may be
worded thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Inside a region occupied by matter, in addition to
the universal ether of space, are certain modified or
electrified specks, which build up the material atoms.
These charged particles, when they move, have
specific inertia, due to the magnetic field surrounding
each of them. And by reason of this property,
and as a consequence of their discontinuity, they
virtually increase the optical density of the ether of
space, acting in analogy with weights distributed
along a flexible cord. Thus they reduce the velocity
of light in the ratio of the refractive index &#956;:1, and
therefore may be taken as increasing the virtual
density of the ether in the ratio 1:&#956;².</p>

<p>That is to say, their loading makes the ether behave
to optical waves as if&mdash;being a homogeneous
medium without these discontinuous loads&mdash;it had
a density &#956;² times that which it has in space outside
matter. Calling the density outside 1, the extra
density inside must be &#956;²&#8722;1, so as to make up the
total to &#956;².</p>

<p>The &#956;²&#8722;1 portion is that which we call "matter,"
and this portion is readily susceptible to locomotion,
being subject to&mdash;that is, accelerated by&mdash;mechanical
force. The free portion of normal density 1 is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
absolutely stationary as regards locomotion, whether
it be inside or outside a region occupied by ordinary
matter, for it is not amenable to either mechanical
or electric forces. They are transmitted by it, but
never terminate upon it; except, indeed, at the
peculiar structure called a wave-front, which simulates
some of the properties of matter.</p>

<p>(If free or unmodified ether can ever be moved
at all, it must be by means of a magnetic field;
along the lines of which it has, in several theories,
been supposed to circulate. Even this, however,
is not real locomotion.)</p>

<p>Fizeau tested that straightforward consequence of
this theory which is known as Fresnel's Law, and
ascertained by experiment that a beam of light was
accelerated or retarded by a stream of water, according
as it travelled with or against the stream. And
he found the magnitude of the effect precisely in
accordance with the ratio of the locomotive portion
of the ether to the whole,&mdash;the fraction (&#956;²&#8722;1)/&#956;² of
the speed of the water being added to or subtracted
from the velocity of light, when a beam was sent
down or up the stream.</p>

<p>But even if another mode of expression be adopted,
the result to be anticipated from this experiment
would be the same.</p>

<p>For instead of saying that a modified portion of the
ether is moving with the full velocity of the body
while the rest is stationary, it is permissible for
some purposes to treat the whole internal ether as
moving with a fraction of the velocity of the body.</p>

<p>On this method of statement the ether outside
a moving body is still absolutely stationary, but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the body advances, ether may be thought of as continually
condensing in front, and, as it were, evaporating
behind; while, inside, it is streaming through
the body in its condensed condition at a pace such
that what is equivalent to the normal quantity of ether
in space may remain absolutely stationary. To this
end its speed backwards relative to the body must
be <i>u</i>/&#956;² and accordingly its speed forward in space
must be <i>u</i>(1 &#8722; 1/&#956;²).</p>

<p>For consider a slab of matter moving flatways
with velocity <i>u</i>; let its internal etherial density be
&#956;², and let the external ether of density 1 be stationary.
Let the forward speed of the internal ether
through space be <i>xu</i>, so that a beam of light therein
would be hurried forward with this velocity. Then
consider two imaginary parallel planes moving with
the slab, one in advance of it and the other inside it,
and express the fact that the amount of ether between
those two planes must continue constant.
The amount streaming relatively backwards through
the first plane as it moves will be measured by <i>u</i>
times the external density, while the amount similarly
streaming backwards through the second plane
will be (<i>u</i> &#8722; <i>xu</i>) times the internal density. But this
latter amount must equal the former amount. In
other words,</p>

<p class="cen"><i>u</i> × 1 must equal (<i>u</i> &#8722; <i>xu</i>) × &#956;².</p>

<p>Consequently <i>x</i> comes out <i>x</i> = (&#956;² &#8722; 1) / &#956;²; which
is Fresnel's incontrovertible law for the convective
effect of moving transparent matter on light inside it.</p>

<p>The whole subject, however, may be treated more
generally, and for every direction of the ray, on the
lines of Chapter <a href="#Page_127">X</a>, thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Inside a transparent body light travels at a
speed V/&#956;; and the ether, which outside drifts at
velocity <i>v</i>, making an angle &#952; with the ray, inside
may be drifting with velocity <i>v</i>´ and angle &#952;´.</p>

<p>Hence the equation to a ray inside such matter is</p>

<p class="cen">T´ = <span class="intbig">&#8747;</span> <span class="num"><i>ds</i></span> /
<span class="denom">((V/&#956;) cos &#949;´ + <i>v</i>´ cos &#952;´)</span> = min.,</p>

<p class="cen">where <span class="num">sin &#949;´</span> / <span class="denom">sin &#952;´</span> =
<span class="num"><i>v</i>´</span> / <span class="denom">(V/&#956;)</span> = &#945;´.</p>

<p>This may be written</p>

<p class="cen">T´ = <span class="intbig">&#8747;</span> <span class="num">cos &#949;´ <i>ds</i></span> /
<span class="denom">V/&#956; (1 &#8722; &#945;´²)</span> &#8722;
<span class="intbig">&#8747;</span> <span class="num"><i>v</i>´ cos &#952;´ <i>ds</i></span> /
<span class="denom">V²/&#956;² (1 &#8722; &#945;´²)</span>;</p>

<p class="noin">the second term alone involves the first power of the
motion, and assuming that &#956;²<i>v</i>´ cos &#952;´ = <i>d</i>&#966;´/<i>ds</i>, and
treating &#945;´ as a quantity too small for its possible
variations to need attention, the expression becomes</p>

<p class="cen">T´ = &#956;T <span class="num">cos &#949;´</span> / <span class="denom">(1 &#8722; &#945;´²)</span> &#8722;
<span class="num">(&#966;´B &#8722; &#966;´A)</span> / <span class="denom">V²(1 &#8722; &#945;´²)</span>,</p>

<p>T being the time of travel through the same space
when empty. Now, if the time of journey and course
of ray, however they be affected by the dense body,
are not to be <i>more</i> affected by reason of etherial
drift through it than if it were so much empty space,
it is necessary that the difference of potential between
two points A and B should be the same
whether the space between is filled with dense matter
or not (or, say, whether the ray-path is taken through
or outside a portion of dense medium). In other
words (calling &#966; the outside and &#966;´ the inside potential
function), in order to secure that T´ shall not differ
from &#956;T by anything depending on the first power of
motion, it is necessary that &#966;´<span class="smcap">B</span>&#8722;&#966;´<span class="smcap">A</span> shall equal
&#966;<span class="smcap">B</span>&#8722;&#966;<span class="smcap">A</span>: i.e. that the potential inside and outside
matter shall be the same up to a constant, or that
&#956;²<i>v</i>´ cos &#952;´ = <i>v</i> cos &#952;; which for the case of drift along
a ray is precisely Fresnel's hypothesis.</p>

<p>Another way of putting the matter is to say that
to the first power of drift velocity</p>

<p class="cen">T´ = &#956; T &#8722; <span class="intbig">&#8747;</span>
(&#956;² <i>v</i>´ cos &#952;´ &#8722; <i>v</i> cos &#952;) <i>ds</i> / V²,</p>

<p class="noin">and that the second or disturbing term must vanish.</p>

<p>Hence Fresnel's hypothesis as to the behaviour of
ether inside matter is equivalent to the assumption
that a potential function, &#8747; &#956;² <i>v</i> cos &#952; <i>ds</i> , exists throughout
all transparent space, so far as motion of ether
alone is concerned.</p>

<p>Given that condition, no first-order interference
effect due to drift can be obtained from stationary
matter by sending rays round any kind of closed
contour; nor can the path of a ray be altered by
etherial drift through any stationary matter. Hence
filling a telescope tube with water cannot modify the
observed amount of stellar aberration.</p>

<p>The equation to a ray in transparent matter moving
with velocity <i>u</i> in a direction &#966;, and subject to an
independent ether drift of speed <i>v</i> in direction &#952;, is</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="intbig">&#8747;</span> <span class="num"><i>ds</i></span> /
<span class="denom">(V/&#956; cos &#949; + <i>v</i>/&#956;² cos &#952; + <i>u</i>[1 &#8722; (1/&#956;²)] cos &#966;)</span> = const.</p>
